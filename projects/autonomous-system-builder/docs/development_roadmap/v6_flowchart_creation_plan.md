# V6 Hybrid Intelligence Flowchart Creation Plan

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines the systematic plan for creating V6 hybrid intelligence flowchart based on:
1. V5 gaps analysis
2. Meta-process architecture requirements  
3. Planning-implementation interface consistency
4. 8-phase methodology integration

## 📋 Current Status Assessment

### **V5 Analysis Complete ✅**
- **V5 has basic meta-process nodes** but lacks precision and planning input handling
- **22 new nodes identified** for V6 enhancement
- **8 existing nodes need enhancement** for better classification
- **Planning input validation missing** - V5 assumes fresh start only

### **Consistency Requirements Identified ✅**
- Must handle **8-phase planning outputs** as implementation inputs
- Must enforce **"cannot modify planning artifacts"** constraint  
- Must provide **precise fresh instance trigger criteria**
- Must integrate with **two-process architecture** (Planning ↔ Implementation)

## 🔧 V6 Creation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Core V6 Structure Design**

**Objective:** Create complete V6 flowchart with all identified enhancements

**Actions:**
1. **Integrate V5 Base Structure**
   - Start with V5 mermaid structure 
   - Preserve all working V5 decision nodes
   - Maintain hybrid intelligence classification (🤖🧠⚡)

2. **Add Planning Input Entry Points**
   - New start flow: Check for planning artifacts vs fresh implementation
   - Planning artifact validation (consistency, not completeness)
   - Load planning context with cross-reference integration

3. **Enhance Meta-Process Decision Tree**
   - Replace vague "planning artifact issue" with specific classifications
   - Add precise fresh instance trigger criteria
   - Detailed evidence package creation process

4. **Add Planning Interface Handling**
   - Decision nodes for different planning challenge types
   - Controlled planning return process with artifact invalidation
   - Interface contract enforcement

**Deliverables:**
- `hook_mermaid_diagram_full6_hybrid_intelligence.txt`
- Complete mermaid flowchart with 22 new nodes + 8 enhanced nodes
- Preserved V5 working structure + meta-process enhancements

### **Phase 2: Planning Input Consistency Validation**

**Objective:** Ensure V6 correctly handles 8-phase planning methodology outputs

**Consistency Checks:**
1. **Planning Artifact Types Alignment**
   - Overview docs (Phase 1)
   - Behavior decisions + acceptance tests (Phase 2) 
   - Architecture decisions + contract integration tests (Phase 3)
   - External dependency docs + external integration tests (Phase 4)
   - Pseudocode + unit tests + implementation integration tests (Phase 5)
   - File structure + cross-references + dependency injection (Phase 6)

2. **Meta-Process Architecture Alignment**
   - Two-process architecture support
   - Fresh instance anti-cheating protocol
   - Evidence package requirements
   - Controlled planning return process

3. **Strategic Sequence Plan Alignment**
   - Interface contract requirements
   - Loose coupling between planning and implementation
   - Precise trigger criteria for meta-process escalation

**Validation Actions:**
- Cross-reference V6 nodes against planning artifact types
- Verify constraint enforcement mechanisms
- Check decision paths against meta-process requirements
- Validate evidence package content specifications

### **Phase 3: V6 Implementation and Testing**

**Objective:** Create working V6 and validate through real usage

**Testing Strategy:**
1. **Apply V6 to Current Test Import Crisis**
   - Use V6 decision tree to handle test collection errors
   - Document decision path taken
   - Validate classification accuracy (SimpleFailure expected)

2. **Test Planning Input Handling**
   - Simulate V6 start with planning artifacts present
   - Validate planning context loading
   - Test planning consistency validation

3. **Test Meta-Process Escalation**
   - Create controlled planning specification inconsistency
   - Validate fresh instance trigger criteria
   - Test evidence package creation

**Success Criteria:**
- V6 correctly classifies test import crisis as SimpleFailure
- V6 properly handles planning artifacts as implementation inputs
- Meta-process escalation works for legitimate planning issues
- Fresh instance evaluation triggered only when appropriate

### **Phase 4: V6 Optimization and Documentation**

**Objective:** Improve V6 based on real usage and document lessons learned

**Optimization Process:**
1. **Usage Feedback Collection**
   - Document where V6 decisions were suboptimal
   - Identify missing decision paths
   - Note unclear or ambiguous decision criteria

2. **V6 Refinement**
   - Add missing decision nodes based on real usage
   - Clarify ambiguous decision criteria
   - Optimize decision tree efficiency

3. **Integration Documentation**
   - Update strategic sequence plan with V6 completion
   - Document V6 integration with meta-process architecture
   - Create V6 usage guidelines for autonomous implementation

**Deliverables:**
- Optimized V6 flowchart
- V6 usage lessons learned document
- Updated strategic sequence plan
- Meta-process architecture integration validation

## 🔍 Key Design Principles for V6

### **Planning Input Handling**
- **Assumption:** Planning artifacts are complete and locked by Phase 8
- **Focus:** Validate consistency, not completeness
- **Constraint:** Cannot modify planning artifacts - must make them pass
- **Interface:** Loose coupling via clear artifact format specifications

### **Fresh Instance Trigger Precision**
Based on meta-process architecture requirements:

**Trigger Fresh Instance:**
- Test specification contradicts test implementation
- Pseudocode assumptions prove invalid during implementation
- Architecture constraints cannot be satisfied
- External dependency specifications are incorrect

**Do NOT Trigger Fresh Instance:**
- Import errors (SimpleFailure)
- Logic bugs in implementation
- Missing implementation methods
- Performance optimization needs

### **Evidence Package Content**
**Required Components:**
- Specific planning artifact section with inconsistency
- Implementation context showing the contradiction
- Concrete examples of the specification failure
- Proposed resolution or clarification needed

**Format:** Structured for fresh instance evaluation without implementation bias

### **Meta-Process Integration**
- **Micro-iterations:** Within implementation (V5-style decisions)
- **Macro-iterations:** Cross-phase returns (back to earlier planning phases)
- **Meta-iterations:** Cross-process returns (challenge planning artifacts via fresh instance)

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### **1. Consistency with Existing Architecture**
- Must align with two-process architecture
- Must enforce planning artifact immutability  
- Must integrate with 8-phase methodology outputs
- Must support strategic sequence plan requirements

### **2. Practical Usability**
- Decision criteria must be clear and measurable
- Fresh instance triggers must be precise
- Evidence package creation must be systematic
- Planning input handling must be robust

### **3. Anti-Fabrication Integrity**
- Fresh instance evaluation prevents cheating
- Evidence-based decision making throughout
- Cannot modify planning artifacts to make tests pass
- Legitimate planning issues escalated appropriately

### **4. Real Usage Validation**
- V6 must work for current test import crisis
- V6 must handle planning artifacts correctly
- Meta-process escalation must work in practice
- Optimization based on actual usage feedback
