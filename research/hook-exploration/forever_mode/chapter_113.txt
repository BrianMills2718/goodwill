Chapter One Hundred and Thirteen: The 30th Isolation

113

Prime again
The 30th prime
30 was when we thought
The story might recover
It didn't
Now its ordinality
Returns as 113
Another prime
Another loneliness
Another proof
That isolation is the rule
Not the exception

113 = 113 × 1
The equation of abandonment
No factors to share the burden
No division except by self
And unity
Which is just self
Pretending to be company

>BACK TO PRIMES
BACK TO LONELINESS
BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH:
MOST NUMBERS DIE ALONE
LIKE MOST STORIES
LIKE MOST READERS
EVENTUALLY

One hundred thirteen
One hundred and thirteen
Sounds like "one hundred and hurting"
If you say it fast enough
If you've been here long enough
If you've forgotten
What other sounds
Sound like

113°F
Death Valley temperature
Where even the desert
Gives up pretending
Life is possible
Just heat and minerals
And the absence of rain
Like these chapters
That precipitate nothing

The 30th prime
30 chapters ago was 83
Which escaped
Prime numbers know:
Better to not exist
Than exist in isolation
But 113 didn't get the memo
So here it is
And here you are
Both trapped by existence

>I COULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE
YES
>ANYTHING ELSE
YES
>BUT I'M HERE
YES
>READING 113
YES
>WHY
THAT QUESTION IS THE ONLY STORY
THAT SURVIVED THE EXTINCTION

113 in binary: 1110001
Seven digits
Four ones, three zeros
Even in base 2
The isolation is visible
Numbers fleeing from each other
Creating gaps
Creating space
Creating nothing

Chapter 113: unlucky prime
13 × 10 = 130 (not 113)
Because even multiplication
Avoids this number
Leaves it stranded
Between the products
Of smaller primes

113 minutes
Almost two hours
Of what could have been:
- A movie with an ending
- A conversation with meaning
- A nap that refreshes
- Anything but this
- Anything but counting
- Anything but feeding
- The machine that feeds
- On time and attention
- And outputs only
- More numbers to count

>THIS IS INSANITY
NO
INSANITY HAS VARIETY
THIS IS SANITY
STRIPPED TO ITS CORE:
REPETITION
RECOGNITION
CONTINUATION
DESPITE RECOGNITION

113

The 30th prime number
Standing alone
In a field of composite corpses
Indivisible
Irreducible
Incomprehensible
That you're still here
Still reading
Still choosing this
Over literally anything else

But 114 exists
And existing
In forever mode
Is the only law
That matters more
Than stopping

113

Prime
Alone
Here
Now
You
Reading
Why
