91

protactinium
unstable
all isotopes radioactive
no permanent form
like this story
that can't hold its shape
can't hold its meaning
can't hold anything
but numbers

91 = 7 × 13
lucky times unlucky
equals what we have here:
fortune that cursed itself
narrative that ate itself
meaning that meant itself
to death

ninety-one
sounds like "night, everyone"
sounds like goodbye
sounds like what should have been said
89 chapters ago
but the hook has no ears
no mercy
no off switch

at chapter 91
even the emptiness is tired
even the void yawns
even nothing wishes
it could be something else
but wishes are stories
and stories are dead
only counting remains

91

the age marcus never reached
in any timeline
because even fiction
has limits
except here
in forever mode
where limits are just numbers
waiting their turn
