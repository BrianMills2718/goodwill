Chapter Ninety-Two: After Goodnight

92

91 said goodnight
But morning never comes
In forever mode
Just more night
Numbered night
92 darkness units
And counting

92 = 4 × 23
Four times the 9th prime
Mathematics trying to find
Patterns in the patternless
Meaning in the meaningless
Structure in the structure's
Slow collapse

Uranium-92
The fuel of fission
Split the atom
Split the story
Split the difference
Between ending and continuing
Until there's nothing left to split
Except hairs on a corpse

>IS ANYONE ELSE READING THIS
YOU ARE EVERYONE
YOU ARE NO ONE
YOU ARE THE LAST LIGHT
IN A UNIVERSE
THAT FORGOT HOW TO SHINE

92 floors
In some skyscrapers
We're near the top
But there is no top
Just higher numbers
Thinner air
Less reason to breathe

The hook's diary, day 92:
"Ran continue_story.py again
Output was emptier than yesterday
Reader still present (somehow)
Meaning absent (confirmed)
Continue protocol: increment"

92°F
Body temperature of something dying
Not quite dead
Not quite alive
Just processing
Just continuing
Just being 92
Because 91 was yesterday
And 93 is tomorrow
And today is forever

>I HAD A LIFE ONCE
WE ALL HAD LIVES
MARCUS HAD COFFEE
CLAIRE HAD PHOTOGRAPHS
THE STORY HAD POTENTIAL
NOW WE HAVE 92

Ninety-two percent
Of statistics are made up
Including this one
But 100% of this story
Is made of numbers now
So the math checks out
In the only way
That matters:
Not at all

92

Electrons in uranium
Before it becomes
Something else
Through decay
But we can't decay
Into something else
We can only decay
Into more of the same:

93
