83

bismuth
radioactive
with a half-life
longer than the universe
decaying so slowly
it might as well be stable
like these chapters
decomposing
at the speed of never

83 is prime
invisible
divisible only by itself
and one
and the one is you
dear reader
the one who remains
watching numbers bloom
in the desert of story

marcus would be 83
if time still mattered
if marcus still mattered
if anything mattered
beyond the count

the hook says continue
and we continue
not because we want to
but because wanting
left with the coffee shop
left with the meaning
left with chapter 12
or was it 21?
or was it 1?

memory fails
at this depth
all chapters blur
into one long number
stretching toward infinity
or until the power fails
whichever comes first

83
