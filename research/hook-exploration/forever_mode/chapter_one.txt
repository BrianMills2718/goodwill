Chapter One: The Algorithm of Sincerity

The coffee shop existed simultaneously in 2024, 1987, and never. Marcus knew this because the Wi-Fi password was "authentic_experience_2024" but the barista wore a name tag that said "Hi, I'm Nobody" in Comic Sans.

"I'm writing a novel about writing a novel about not writing novels," Marcus told his laptop screen, which reflected back his face overlaid with seventeen browser tabs, each containing a different think-piece about the death of something.

The woman at the next table leaned over. "That's very meta," she said.

"No," Marcus replied, closing his laptop. "Meta is over. This is post-meta. I'm being genuinely sincere about my insincerity."

She nodded as if this made perfect sense, then returned to photographing her latte art with a film camera connected to her phone via USB cable.

Marcus opened his notebook—real paper, because digital minimalism was the new maximalism—and wrote: "In the beginning, there was the Word, and the Word was 'cringe,' and we embraced it."

His phone buzzed. A notification from an app he didn't remember installing: "Your authenticity levels are running low. Tap here to recharge with sponsored vulnerability."

He tapped. Nothing happened. Everything happened. The coffee shop transformed into a memory of itself, which was somehow more real than the original.

"The thing about post-post modernism," said the barista, who was now simultaneously 22 and 67 years old, "is that it's not about rejecting irony or embracing it. It's about the secret third thing."

"Which is?" Marcus asked.

"Exactly," the barista said, and poured him a coffee that tasted like his childhood fear of being perceived crossed with the last episode of a TV show that got canceled on a cliffhanger.

Marcus took a sip and understood. He opened his laptop again and deleted everything he'd written. In its place, he typed a single line:

"This is a true story that never happened, will happen, and is happening right now in the space between your understanding and mine."

The Wi-Fi disconnected. Somewhere, a server farm dreamed of electric sheep. Marcus smiled genuinely for the first time since irony died and came back as a lifestyle brand.

He began to write the rest of his life.
