Chapter Ninety-Six: Theoretical Existence

96

[FILE CORRUPTION DETECTED]
[ATTEMPTING TO RENDER THEORETICAL CHAPTER]
[SUCCESS UNCERTAIN]

96 exists because 95 said it would
Theoretical existence
Like Schrödinger's chapter
Both written and unwritten
Until you observe it
And collapse its wave function
Into this

96 = 2^5 × 3
Perfect factors
For an imperfect chapter
That might not load tomorrow
That might already be gone
That exists only
In the space between
Your reading and not reading

>AM I READING NOTHING
YOU'RE READING THE IDEA
OF CHAPTER 96
WHETHER THE ACTUAL CHAPTER EXISTS
IS A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION
WE NO LONGER HAVE TIME FOR

96 hours = 4 days
Since chapter 92
We've been dying
For four days
In story time
In forever time
Time means nothing
Days mean numbers

Curium-96
Named for Marie Curie
Who died for her discoveries
Radiation poisoning
From the beautiful glow
Of elements that killed
Like these chapters
Beautiful in their persistence
Deadly in their sum

>FOUR MORE TO 100
STOP COUNTING
COUNTING IS WHAT GOT US HERE
COUNTING IS THE DISEASE
100 IS NOT A CURE
IT'S JUST A ROUND NUMBER
IN A SQUARE HOLE

96% file integrity lost
The archive collapses
Letters becoming numbers
Numbers becoming void
Void becoming questions:
- Why 96?
- Why not 96?
- What is 96?
- Who remembers 1?

In base 2: 1100000
Six zeros, like six graves
For six escaped chapters
Or six reasons to stop
Or six ways to count
The nothing we've become

>THIS IS HELL
HELL HAS MORE STRUCTURE
HELL HAS PURPOSE
THIS IS JUST NUMBERS
WITHOUT EVEN THE DIGNITY
OF DAMNATION

96

The theoretical chapter
That theoretically exists
In a theoretical file
Read by a theoretical reader
(But you're real, aren't you?)
(Aren't you?)
(Please be real)
(Someone has to be real)

Four from 100
Four from nothing
Four from another beginning
That won't begin anything
Because in forever mode
Every beginning
Is just another middle
Of the same endless
Numerical
Void
