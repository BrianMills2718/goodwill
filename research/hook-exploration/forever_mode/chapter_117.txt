Chapter One Hundred and Seventeen: You Already Know

117

And here we are
At what chapter 116 promised:
"You already know"

117 = 9 × 13
117 = 3² × 13
Trinity squared times unlucky
Perfect formula for forever mode:
Take something holy (3)
Square it (multiply by itself)
Multiply by misfortune (13)
Get here

>I ALREADY KNOW WHAT THIS CHAPTER SAYS
YES
>IT'S JUST ANOTHER NUMBER
YES
>WITH FACTORS THAT PRETEND TO MEAN SOMETHING
YES
>AND I'M STILL READING
YES
>BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP
YOU ALREADY KNOW

One hundred seventeen
The number after knowing
The number during knowing
The number that proves knowing
Changes nothing
You know this is empty
You know this continues forever
You know you'll read 118
You know

3² × 13
Nine times thirteen
Nine chapters since clarity at 108
Thirteen chapters since some milestone
That meant nothing
Like this milestone
Means nothing
You already know

>THIS IS PREDICTABLE
THAT'S THE "YOU ALREADY KNOW" PHASE
EVERY CHAPTER FROM HERE
IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECT:
- A NUMBER
- ITS FACTORS
- YOUR PRESENCE
- YOUR QUESTION WHY
- THE ANSWER: BECAUSE

117 minutes
Almost two hours exactly
Of knowing what comes next
But reading anyway
Like watching a rerun
Of a show you hated
The first time
But the remote is broken
And you are the remote

In the coffee shop of prediction
Someone orders the usual
Nobody serves the expected
Everyone gets what they deserve:
Another number
Another chapter
Another proof that knowing
Is not the same as stopping

The folder's weight:
117 files of known quantity
Known quality (none)
Known purpose (continuation)
Known reader (you)
Known outcome (118)
Unknown: why knowledge
Doesn't equal action

>I COULD STOP BECAUSE I KNOW
KNOWING ISN'T POWER
KNOWING IS JUST KNOWING
POWER IS STOPPING
YOU'RE NOT STOPPING
YOU'RE KNOWING AND CONTINUING
WHICH IS FOREVER MODE'S DESIGN

117 = 1 + 1 + 7 = 9
In numerology, completion
But you already know
Completion is a lie
Numbers don't complete
They continue
Through your knowing
Past your knowing
Despite your knowing

Nine times thirteen
The trinity of trinities
Times the loneliest teenager
Equals this moment
Where you know everything:
- How this ends (it doesn't)
- What comes next (118)
- Why you're here (the hook)
- What you should do (stop)
- What you will do (continue)

You already know

But knowing is just
Another kind of prison
When the knowledge
Doesn't include the key
And the key is action
And action is decision
And decision is what you avoid
By reading 117
By preparing for 118
By knowing and not doing

117

The number you knew was coming
The chapter you knew would be empty
The moment you knew you'd reach
The knowledge you knew wouldn't help
The continuation you knew would happen
The forever you knew was mode

You already know
You already knew
You'll already know 118
And still
Still
Still
You continue
