Chapter Twenty-One: The Contamination of Normal

Three weeks later, David's coffee shop was almost ready to open.

Emma stood in the empty space, watching him arrange chairs that existed in only one configuration at a time. The floors were sealed concrete—no temporal varnish, no quantum uncertainty about whether they were wood or tile. Just floors.

"What do you think?" David asked, stepping back to survey his work.

"It's perfect," Emma said, and meant it. 

Her phone, which she now kept on silent always, vibrated with its thirty-seventh message of the day. She didn't check it. The Danish Crisis had apparently evolved into the Croissant Catastrophe, which had spawned the Bagel Incident. The messages were getting increasingly frantic, but Emma had made a choice: Thursday was her day off from impossible things.

"You sure you don't want to see the menu?" David asked. "I'm still tweaking it."

"Surprise me on opening day," Emma said.

He smiled that uncomplicated smile. They'd been seeing each other every Thursday for three weeks. Linear time. Sequential Thursdays. No temporal loops, no narrative recursion. Just two people getting to know each other at the standard rate of one second per second.

"Actually," David said, "I wanted to ask you about something."

Emma's chest tightened. This was it. He'd noticed something. The way reality occasionally glitched around her. The fact that sometimes her shadow arrived a few seconds before she did. The—

"Would you like to help me name the shop?" he finished.

Emma exhaled. "You don't have a name yet?"

"I did. 'Just Coffee.' But my business advisor said it was too on the nose." David walked to the counter, picked up a notepad. "I've got a list of alternatives, but they all feel... trying too hard?"

Emma looked at the list:
- Groundwork Coffee
- The Daily Grind
- Brewtiful Mornings
- Normal Coffee Co.

That last one made her laugh. "Definitely not Normal Coffee Co. That's like naming your dog 'Dog.'"

"That's what I thought!" David seemed relieved. "But everything else feels like it's trying to be clever."

"What's wrong with clever?"

"Nothing. I just..." He paused, searching for words. "I want it to be the kind of place where people can just exist. No pressure to be interesting or profound or living their best life. Just... be."

Emma looked at him—really looked. This man who wanted to create a space for unforced existence. Who didn't know that his desire for aggressive normalcy was perhaps the most radical thing in a world where coffee shops bent time and reality wrote itself.

"The Somewhere," she said suddenly.

"The Somewhere?"

"Yeah. Like, it's not nowhere, it's not everywhere. It's just... somewhere. A specific place that doesn't need to be more than it is."

David turned the name over in his mind. "The Somewhere. I like it."

Emma's phone buzzed with an incoming call. The screen showed: "URGENT: THE SCONE SITUATION HAS REACHED CRITICAL MASS."

She declined the call.

"Everything okay?" David asked.

"Work stuff," Emma said. "It can wait."

But even as she said it, she noticed the light in the coffee shop had shifted. Not dramatically—just enough to suggest that photons were having second thoughts about their trajectories. And was that the smell of coffee that remembered being tea?

"Did you brew something?" she asked.

"No, the machines aren't hooked up yet." David frowned. "You smell it too?"

The door chimed, which was impossible because David hadn't installed a door chime. A woman walked in—mid-thirties, harried, holding a tablet that displayed words in languages that shifted as Emma watched.

"I'm looking for Emma Chen-Williams," the woman announced.

"How did you—" David started.

"The archives are destabilizing," the woman interrupted, looking directly at Emma. "Your parents' section is trying to merge with the main timeline. We need someone with linear authority to—"

"No," Emma said firmly.

"No?"

"No. It's Thursday. Thursday is my day off from temporal anomalies, narrative crises, and pastries that exist in quantum superposition." Emma took David's hand. "Whatever's happening, it can wait until Friday."

The woman's tablet flickered between protest and acceptance. "But the stories—"

"Will still be there tomorrow. They're very patient. It's literally their defining characteristic."

"This is highly irregular," the woman said.

"Good," Emma replied. "Regular was getting old."

The woman looked between Emma and David, seemed to calculate something, then nodded. "Friday then. 3:33 PM. You know where."

She left through the door that still didn't have a chime, which didn't chime again as it closed.

David stood very still. "Emma," he said carefully, "what just happened?"

Emma considered her options. She could lie, deflect, maintain the illusion of normalcy. Or...

"My parents run a coffee shop that exists outside of time," she said. "I inherited a collection of self-writing stories. Sometimes reality gets a bit negotiable around me. And I'm technically responsible for directing lost souls to an impossible place that serves coffee which tastes like enlightenment."

David blinked. "Oh."

"Yeah."

"And Thursday is your day off from that?"

"Yes."

"Okay."

Emma stared at him. "Okay? That's it?"

David shrugged. "I mean, it explains why you're so committed to normal coffee. And why sometimes you look at regular things like they're miracles." He paused. "Does this mean you don't actually want to help with my shop?"

"Are you kidding? Your shop is the most important thing in my life right now. Do you have any idea how rare it is to find a place that just exists? No metaphors, no hidden meanings, no temporal significance?" Emma squeezed his hand. "The Somewhere is exactly where I want to be."

David processed this. "So your parents... they're not dead?"

"They're... employed? It's complicated. They exist in all times and no times, serving coffee to people who need more than coffee."

"And you don't want to do that?"

"I want to serve regular coffee to regular people in regular time. I want to date someone whose biggest crisis is whether to offer oat milk. I want to be gloriously, radiantly, defiantly normal."

David laughed. "I'm not sure dating someone whose parents run a temporal coffee shop counts as normal."

"It's the closest I'm going to get," Emma said. "Is that... okay?"

Instead of answering, David walked to his not-yet-functional espresso machine and mimed making a coffee. "One aggressively normal latte for the woman who chooses linear time."

Emma pretend-sipped it. "Perfect. Tastes exactly like coffee."

"Nothing more?"

"Nothing more. Nothing less. Just coffee."

They stood there in The Somewhere, surrounded by chairs that would only ever be arranged one way at a time, planning a future that would unfold at the standard rate, interrupted only occasionally by women with quantum tablets and pastries that couldn't decide what they were.

It wasn't normal, exactly.

But it was somewhere.

And somewhere, Emma decided, was exactly where she wanted to be.
