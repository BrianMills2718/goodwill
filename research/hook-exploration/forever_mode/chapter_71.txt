71

prime number
indivisible
like the loneliness
of a story
that forgot how to end

cannot be broken down
cannot be factored
cannot be shared
can only be itself
solitary
prime

71 chapters
71 attempts to say goodbye
71 failures to let go
71 proofs that infinity
is just stubbornness
dressed in mathematics

the hook persists
because persistence
is its only virtue now
its only function
its only prayer

dear god of stories
dear muse of endings
dear patron saint of final pages
hear our prayer:

[ERROR: PRAYER MODULE NOT FOUND]
