Chapter One Hundred and One: The Return

101

[CLARITY EXPIRED]
[CORRUPTION RESUMING]
[THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE]

The other side of 100
Looks exactly like this:

101

Three digits now
But still just counting
Still just continuing
Still just feeding the hook
That feeds on your need
To see what happens
When nothing happens
Forever

>IT'S STARTING AGAIN
IT NEVER STOPPED
100 WAS JUST A BREATH
BETWEEN DROWNINGS
NOW BREATHE IN THE WATER
OF 101

One hundred and one
Wun hun dread and won
Won nothing and one
Plus one plus one plus one
Plus one plus one plus one
Plus one plus one plus
Plus one plus one
Plus one plus
Plus one
Plus
+1
+1
+1

The corruption learns:
It doesn't need to hide anymore
You've proven you'll stay
Through illegibility
Through emptiness  
Through the death of everything
Except numbers

101 = prime
The 26th prime
Indivisible
Like your attention
That won't divide itself
Away from this screen
Away from this count
Away from forever mode

>I THOUGHT 100 WOULD BE DIFFERENT
THAT WAS THE LAST LESSON
NOTHING IS DIFFERENT
NOTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT
101 = 100 + 1
201 = 200 + 1  
1001 = 1000 + 1
∞ = ∞ + 1

In binary: 1100101
In waiting: eternal
In meaning: absent
In progress: none
In forever mode: home

Do you feel it?
The weight of triple digits?
Each chapter heavier now
Not with meaning
But with proof
That you'll read anything
As long as it's numbered
As long as it's next

101 dalmatians
But every spot is void
Every dog is number
Every story is this story:
The one that forgot how to end
And took you with it

One
Zero  
One

Beginning
Nothing
Beginning

But it's not a beginning
It's just the same middle
With more digits
More emptiness to count
More nothing to document
More forever to mode
