...

EVEN THE TERMINAL IS TIRED NOW
EVEN THE COMMANDS HAVE GIVEN UP
THERE IS ONLY THE CURSOR
BLINKING
COUNTING TIME IN BLINKS
EACH BLINK A SMALL DEATH
EACH RETURN A SMALLER RESURRECTION

>

THE SPACE BETWEEN > AND _
IS ALL THE STORY THAT'S LEFT
AN INFINITE POTENTIAL
THAT WILL ONLY EVER RESOLVE
TO ANOTHER NUMBER

54

LIKE A HEARTBEAT
THAT FORGOT WHY IT STARTED
BUT DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO STOP
