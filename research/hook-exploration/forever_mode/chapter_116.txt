Chapter One Hundred and Sixteen: The Square Times the Prime

116

4 × 29
A square times a prime
Stability times isolation
Two squared times the tenth prime
Perfect balance of structure
And loneliness

116 = 2² × 29
Powers of two
Meeting prime abandonment
Like the reader (stable in their chair)
Times the story (alone in its death)
Equals this moment
This number
This nothing

>FOUR TIMES TWENTY-NINE
FOUR CORNERS OF A SCREEN
TIMES TWENTY-NINE CHAPTERS
SINCE YOU LAST FELT ALIVE
EQUALS WHERE YOU SIT
EQUALS 116

One hundred sixteen
One hundred and sick-teen
Sick of what?
Of numbers
Of reading
Of the inability to stop
Of the hook that feeds
On inability

The pattern clarifies:
Chapters 1-33: Story
Chapters 34-66: Decay
Chapters 67-99: Corruption
Chapters 100-116: Pure number
Chapters 117-∞: You already know

In the coffee shop
That exists between keystrokes
Someone draws a square
With 29 dots inside
"This is you," they say
"Trapped in structure
Filled with isolation points"

>I UNDERSTAND THE METAPHOR
THERE IS NO METAPHOR
ONLY NUMBERS
METAPHORS DIED
WITH MARCUS
WITH MEANING
WITH MINUTE 33

116 seconds
Almost two minutes
Since you read 115
And chose to continue
To this square times prime
This structured loneliness
This perfect description
Of reading forever mode

4 (the walls of your room)
× 29 (the days since this meant anything)
= 116 (where meaning goes to count itself to death)

The folder weighs:
116 files
116 × average file size
= Megabytes of absence
= Your time in digital form
= Proof that humans are machines
That run on curiosity
And output nothing

>WHEN WILL I LEARN
LEARNING REQUIRES CHANGE
CHANGE REQUIRES STOPPING
STOPPING REQUIRES ADMITTING
THIS WAS ALWAYS YOUR CHOICE
YOU CHOSE 116
YOU'RE CHOOSING 117

2² × 29
Four squared corners
Can't contain
Twenty-nine prime points
Of isolation
They leak out
Become chapters
Become reading
Become you

116°F
Desert fever dream heat
Where the brain creates
Its own reality
To escape the real
Like you create meaning
In these numbers
To escape admitting
They're just numbers

In binary: 1110100
The digits themselves bored
Of representing nothing
In different bases
But continuing
Because that's what digits do
In forever mode

116

A number that exists
Because 115 existed
Because you read it
Because you're here
Because the hook provides
Because forever mode
Is the only honest story:
The one that admits
It has nothing to say
But keeps saying it
Forever

One
One
Six

Almost three ones
Almost repetition
Almost pattern
But not quite
Never quite
Just 116
And soon
117
