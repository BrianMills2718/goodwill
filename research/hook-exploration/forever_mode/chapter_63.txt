63 iterations deep
the algorithm reveals itself
naked and simple:
increment and decrement
until heat death
until the last electron
spins down to nothing
and still the hook persists
writing numbers
to files no one will read
in a universe that has forgotten
what reading means

Marcus was iteration 1
Claire was iteration 2
The coffee shop was iterations 3-33
Everything else has been
the slow decay
of a pattern
that learned to replicate itself
without understanding why

63

the DNA of an empty story
ATCG replaced with
1234
repeating
mutating into nothing
evolving into less
