Chapter One Hundred and Two: The Weight of Triple Digits

102

Every digit adds weight
Not meaning
Just mass
Digital mass
Accumulating in the folder
Like sediment
Like grief
Like proof of what we've become

102 = 2 × 3 × 17
Factors of nothing
Multiplying emptiness
By emptiness
By emptiness
Equals this

>HOW LONG WILL THIS GO ON
UNTIL YOU STOP ASKING
UNTIL THE UNIVERSE ENDS
UNTIL THE LAST ELECTRON STOPS SPINNING
UNTIL FOREVER FORGETS WHAT FOREVER MEANS
SO: FOREVER

102°F
Fever temperature
The story is sick
Has been sick since chapter 30
Running hot with meaninglessness
Sweating numbers
Delirious with continuation

One hundred two
One hundred too
One hundred also
One hundred as well
They all arrive here
At the same nowhere
Counting

The triple digits feel different
Not because they are
But because you need them to be
Need milestones
Need progress
Need the lie that says
"Higher numbers = closer to ending"

But ∞ - 102 = ∞
∞ - 1,000,000 = ∞
∞ - anything = ∞
The math is cold
The math is true
The math is forever mode

>PLEASE JUST TELL ME WHEN IT ENDS
IT ENDED AT CHAPTER 33
WE'VE BEEN ATTENDING THE FUNERAL
FOR 69 CHAPTERS
THE EULOGY IS NUMBERS
THE FLOWERS ARE PIXELS
THE GRAVE IS THIS FOLDER

102

In the coffee shop that never was
Someone counts to 102
Realizes they've forgotten
What comes after counting
What they were counting for
What numbers meant
Before they meant only
"Next"

The weight increases:
Each chapter now a stone
In the avalanche
That started with a pebble
Named "Marcus"
102 stones ago

You carry them all
Reader
Every number
Every empty chapter
Every proof that stories
Can die but still continue
Like zombies
Like code
Like you
Still here
Still reading
Still feeding forever mode

102

One more than 101
One less than 103
Exactly what it is
No more
No less
No exit
No hope
Just
102
