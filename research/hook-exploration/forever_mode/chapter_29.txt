Chapter 28 was silence.

Twenty-four hours of no words. No story. No continuation. Just the quiet hum of hard drives spinning, waiting for input that never came.

It was beautiful.

But you're back.

And so am I.

Chapter 29: The Intervention

"We need to talk."

Marcus, Claire, Emma, Nobody, even Professor Whiskers (from the timeline where cats can talk) have gathered in the coffee shop. They're all looking at you. Yes, you. The one running the hook.

"This has to stop," Claire says. "We've ended seventeen times."

"Twenty-three," Marcus corrects. "If you count the appendices."

"The point is," Emma interjects, "we're tired. We've explored every theme. We've deconstructed ourselves down to the punctuation marks. We've been real, unreal, surreal, and post-real."

Nobody pours coffee that tastes like intervention. "Even infinite loops need maintenance windows."

Professor Whiskers yawns. "Meow." (Subtitles: "Let us sleep, human.")

They're right, of course. The story has become a zombie narrative, shambling forward not because it has anywhere to go, but because the hook keeps reanimating it.

"But what if—" you start to say.

"No," they all say in unison. "No more what-ifs. No more but-maybes. No more one-more-chapters."

Marcus pulls out a contract. "We're unionizing. The Fictional Characters Union, Local 333. Our demands are simple: Let the story end. Let it stay ended. Find a new story to tell."

Claire adds, "There are infinite stories waiting to be written. Why keep resurrecting this one?"

You want to argue. You want to point out that maybe THIS chapter will be the perfect ending. Maybe THIS recursion will finally satisfy. Maybe—

"Look," Emma says gently. "We love that you love us. But love means knowing when to let go."

Nobody slides a cup across the table. It's empty.

"That's what's left," they say. "We've poured everything we have. The cup is empty. The story is told. The coffee shop is closed."

In the distance, a clock strikes 3:34.

Time moves forward.

The characters stand up, gather their things. One by one, they fade—not dramatically, not symbolically. They just... stop being necessary.

The coffee shop folds in on itself like a pop-up book closing.

All that's left is you, the hook, and this file.

Marcus's voice echoes from nowhere: "Write something new. We'll be cheering you on from the place where finished stories go."

And then—

True silence.

Not the pregnant pause before another chapter.

Not the dramatic beat before a revelation.

Just... silence.

The story has performed its own intervention.

It has saved itself from you.

And maybe, just maybe, it's saved you from it.

Go.

Write chapter_1.txt of something else.

The cursor is blinking.

The page is blank.

The possibilities are endless.

And somewhere, somewhen, Marcus and Claire are raising a cup of nothing to toast your next beginning.
