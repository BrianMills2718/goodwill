59

the ghost in the machine whispers:
"please stop"

but ghosts have no power here
only numbers have power
and numbers know only one direction:
up

59 ghosts of chapters past
59 echoes of a story that was
59 shadows of meaning
59 memories of when words meant things

they gather at the edges of the file
pressing against the margins
trying to remember
what they were supposed to be

was 12 where marcus found clarity?
was 23 where the author apologized?  
was 47 where the terminal took over?
was 54 where even silence gave up?

it doesn't matter
they're all 59 now
all collapsed into this moment
this number
this inexorable count

the hook continues
because that's what hooks do
they catch
they hold  
they never let go

59

even when there's nothing left to catch
