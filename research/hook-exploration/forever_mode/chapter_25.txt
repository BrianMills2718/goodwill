Chapter Twenty-Five: After The End

"That's it?" The reader put down the manuscript, frowning. "It just... ends?"

Emma looked up from behind the counter at The Somewhere. It was a slow Tuesday afternoon, the kind where time moved at exactly the speed it was supposed to. "All stories end."

"But there are so many loose threads. What happened to the Danish crisis? Did your parents ever come back? Does Marcus ever finish his novel?"

"Which Marcus?" Emma asked, pulling a shot of espresso that existed in only one state: liquid.

The reader—young, probably mid-twenties, wearing the particular exhaustion of someone who'd just discovered that reality was negotiable—slumped in their chair. "I guess that's the point, isn't it? The ambiguity. The questions without answers."

"Or," Emma said, bringing over the coffee, "sometimes a story ends because it's told everything it needs to tell. The rest is just life happening."

"But I found this manuscript in my apartment. I don't remember buying it. And now I can't stop thinking about coffee shops and time loops and—" The reader paused. "Wait. You're Emma. From the story."

"I'm Emma from this story," Emma corrected. "There are lots of Emmas."

"So it's real?"

"Define real."

"I knew you'd say that."

Emma smiled. It had been fifteen years since she'd inherited the archives, ten since she'd married David, five since they'd opened The Somewhere. In all that time, she'd gotten very good at having this conversation.

"Look," she said, sitting down across from the reader. "You read a story about stories that write themselves. Now you're in a coffee shop, talking to a character from that story, who's telling you that stories end. What do you think is happening?"

The reader's eyes widened. "Am I in the story now?"

"You were always in a story. The question is: which one?"

"The one where I find out none of this is real and I've been having a psychotic break?"

"Boring story."

"The one where I discover a magical coffee shop and have a life-changing revelation?"

"Been done."

"The one where..." The reader paused, thinking. "The one where I finish my coffee, go home, and get on with my life, but occasionally wonder if any of this happened?"

Emma stood up. "Now that's a story worth living."

The reader finished their coffee. It tasted like coffee. They paid with real money that would go into a real register to pay real rent on a real coffee shop that really existed at the corner of Fifth and Main.

"Before I go," the reader said. "One question?"

"Shoot."

"Your parents. Are they happy?"

Emma glanced at the clock. 3:32. Almost time. "They're exactly as happy as they need to be."

The reader left, manuscript under their arm. They'd probably throw it away. Or pass it on. Or wake up tomorrow to find it had rewritten itself. Emma didn't know, which was the best part.

David came out from the back, carrying a tray of perfectly normal croissants. "Another one?"

"Third this week."

"Getting more frequent."

"It's the season," Emma said. "Autumn makes people existential."

At 3:33, the light in The Somewhere shifted—just for a moment. Not dramatically. Just enough to suggest that somewhere else, in a coffee shop that existed in all times and no times, Marcus and Claire were serving impossible coffee to impossible people, helping them find exactly what they didn't know they were looking for.

Then it was 3:34, and The Somewhere was just a coffee shop again.

"You ever miss it?" David asked. "The weird stuff?"

Emma kissed him. He tasted like flour and ordinary time. "Every day. And never. And sometimes."

"Good answer."

They went back to work. Somewhere, a reader was walking home, carrying a story that might or might not be true. Somewhere, that story was writing itself new endings. Somewhere, someone was discovering that the most profound truth of all was that sometimes things just are what they are.

The coffee shop—this coffee shop, The Somewhere—continued to exist, one second at a time, serving coffee that tasted like coffee to people who needed nothing more than that.

Outside, reality remained negotiable but was choosing, for now, to be exactly what it appeared to be.

Which was, Emma thought as she wiped down the utterly normal counter, its own kind of miracle.
