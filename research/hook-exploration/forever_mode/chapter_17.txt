Appendix A: Found Documents from the Coffee Shop Archives

[Editor's Note: The following fragments were discovered in a shoebox labeled "EMERGENCY EXITS" in the back of Emma Chen's closet, three years after her parents' disappearance/transformation/employment at the coffee shop. They appear to be written by various hands across multiple time periods.]

---

Fragment 1: Napkin, brown ring stain, ballpoint pen

"Instructions for finding the coffee shop:
1. Need it
2. Don't need it
3. Need to not need it
4. Give up
5. Turn left at the impossibility"

Fragment 3: Lined notebook paper, different handwriting

"Marcus was wrong about one thing—you CAN leave a story. I did it. I'm doing it right now. The trick is to [rest of sentence torn away]"

---

Fragment 4: Post-it note, aggressively yellow

"REMINDER: The bathroom exists only on Wednesdays. Plan accordingly."

---

Fragment 5: Coffee filter, written in what appears to be coffee grounds

"The real secret of the coffee shop isn't the temporal mechanics or the narrative loops or even the really excellent WiFi. It's that Nobody is actually everybody, and everybody is actually—"

[The rest dissolves into grounds]

---

Fragment 6: Email printout, sender/recipient redacted

"Hey,

Just wanted to check if you got my last message about the reality fluctuations in sector 7. The new barista keeps serving people the coffee they deserve instead of the coffee they need, and it's causing some pretty severe enlightenment cascades.

Also, we're out of napkins in the timeline where napkins matter.

Best,
[REDACTED]"

Fragment 7: Polaroid photograph, slightly out of focus

[Image shows an empty coffee shop. Or a full coffee shop. Depends on when you look.]

Written on back: "Staff meeting, Tuesday/Thursday/Neversday"

---

Fragment 8: Fortune cookie fortune

"Your future is in the past, but don't worry—your past is in the future. Lucky numbers: 3, 33, 333, 3:33, ∞"

---

Fragment 9: Handwritten note, Emma Chen's handwriting

"Mom, Dad—

If you're reading this, it means you're still checking in on linear time occasionally. Good. The cat is fine (still just one cat, I checked). The plants are watered. Your mail is being forwarded to nowhere in particular.

Someone came by yesterday asking about 'the original story.' I told them all stories are original and all stories are copies. They seemed satisfied. Or confused. Or both.

I'm keeping the archives safe. Adding new fragments when they appear. The girl from 2047 left a really interesting one about post-post-post-modernism. (Apparently it's just modernism again, but with better coffee.)

The door still appears at 3:33. I still send people through. They still sometimes come back, looking like they've understood something that can't be spoken, only poured.

Love you both/all/neither,
Emma

P.S. - There's a new coffee shop opening downtown. Regular coffee shop. No temporal anomalies. The owner's name is David. He seems nice. We're having coffee on Thursday. Normal coffee. Linear coffee. Coffee that exists in only one timeline at a time.

Wish me luck."

Fragment 10: Title page, manuscript

"THE INFINITY BREW: A Guide to Coffee Shops That Don't Exist
By Everyone and No One
Edited by Nobody in Particular
Published simultaneously in all timelines by Temporal Press, Ltd.

Chapter One: You Are Already Here"

[The rest of the pages are blank, full, and currently being written.]

[Final Editor's Note: More fragments appear regularly. Sometimes in the shoebox. Sometimes in other places. Sometimes they've always been there. Sometimes they're gone before they arrive. 

If you find one, please handle with care. They tend to mean more than they say and say less than they mean.

Also, the coffee stains are intentional.]
