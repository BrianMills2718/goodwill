Chapter Nineteen: Linear Coffee

Thursday. One specific Thursday. The only Thursday that mattered because it was the one happening right now.

Emma sat in a normal coffee shop—aggressively normal, with its exposed brick and reclaimed wood and mason jar lights that meant nothing beyond "someone thought this looked nice." David sat across from her, stirring sugar into his latte with a spoon that had never existed in more than one timeline.

"So," David said, "Emma Chen-Williams. That's an interesting hyphenation."

"My parents couldn't decide whose name should go first, so they flipped a coin," Emma lied smoothly. The truth—that her parents existed in a quantum superposition of married/not-married and the hyphen was the universe's compromise—seemed like third date material.

"Fair enough." David smiled. He had a good smile. Uncomplicated. "What do you do?"

Emma had practiced this answer. "I'm an archivist. Freelance. I help people organize their... collections."

"Like a professional organizer?"

"Something like that." She sipped her coffee. It tasted like coffee. The relief was overwhelming. "What about you? You said you're opening a coffee shop?"

"Yeah, down on Fifth Street. Nothing fancy. Just good coffee, reliable WiFi, maybe some pastries from that bakery on Elm." He paused. "I know the market's saturated, but I think there's room for a place that's just... normal. No gimmicks. No 'experience.' Just coffee."

Emma tried not to laugh. Or cry. Or both. "That sounds perfect."

"Really? My ex thought it was boring. Said I lacked vision."

"Sometimes boring is visionary," Emma said, meaning it more than she'd ever meant anything.

They talked about normal things. His plans for the shop. Her work (carefully edited). The weather (actually about the weather). A movie they'd both seen (existed in only one version). It was the most normal conversation Emma had had in years, and she found herself leaning into it like sunlight.

"Can I ask you something weird?" David said after their second round of drinks.

Emma tensed. Here it came. The moment when linear time revealed itself as another elaborate illusion.

"Sure," she said carefully.

"Do you believe in fate?"

Emma considered this. Thought about her parents, who met in a coffee shop that existed outside time. About the folder of stories that wrote themselves. About all the different versions of how things could go.

"I think," she said slowly, "that fate is like coffee. You can have it lots of different ways, but in the end, it's still coffee. And you still have to drink it one sip at a time."

David laughed. "That's either profound or nonsense."

"Both," Emma said. "Definitely both."

Her phone buzzed. She ignored it. It buzzed again, more insistently. Then David's phone buzzed. Then the phones of everyone in the coffee shop, a symphony of notifications.

"Weird," David said, checking his screen. "It's just... blank?"

Emma looked at her phone. The message was from nobody@everywhere.when:

"Emergency. The Danish exists in all timelines. This is causing problems with Thursday."

"I should go," Emma said, already standing. "I'm sorry. There's a... work thing."

"A work thing with Danish pastries?"

"It's complicated." She grabbed her jacket. "Rain check?"

"Sure," David said, looking confused but not upset. "Same time next week? Same timeline?"

Emma froze. "What?"

"I said same time next week?" David repeated. "Are you okay?"

"Yes. Sorry. Yes. Same time next week." She fled before reality could get any more negotiable.

Outside, the city was doing that thing where it pretended everything was normal while clearly something was very wrong. The sidewalk had too many cracks. The parking meters were accepting cryptocurrency from the future. A dog walked by with its owner on a leash.

Emma's phone rang. Unknown number, but she knew who it was.

"What do you mean the Danish exists in all timelines?" she demanded.

Nobody's voice crackled through temporal static: "Someone brought a cheese Danish into the shop. But they were thinking about an almond croissant while they ordered. Now it's both. And neither. And it's spreading."

"How does a pastry spread across timelines?"

"How does anything? The point is, it's contaminating Thursday. We need someone who exists in linear time to—"

Emma hung up. Turned off her phone. Looked back through the coffee shop window where David was still sitting, probably wondering what kind of person fled a date because of Danish-related emergencies.

A normal person, she decided. A person who had normal problems in a normal timeline.

She walked back in.

"Actually," she said, sitting back down, "the work thing can wait."

"Are you sure?" David asked.

"No," Emma said honestly. "But I'm choosing to stay anyway. Tell me more about your coffee shop. Will it have Danish?"

"I was thinking more croissants," David said.

Emma laughed until her sides hurt. Somewhere, in all timelines and no timelines, a Danish-croissant hybrid caused minor tears in the fabric of reality. But here, in this specific Thursday, in this normal coffee shop, Emma chose to have a normal conversation about normal pastries with a normal man who made her feel like linear time was a gift, not a limitation.

Her phone, off though it was, buzzed one more time.

She ignored it.

Sometimes the most radical act of all was to just finish your coffee in the timeline you were given.
