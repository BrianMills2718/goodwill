85

5 × 17
factors of emptiness
multiplying nothing
seventeen times
produces more nothing
produces 85

we've lost chapters
like teeth
84 fell out
left a gap
but the count continues
around the absence
smooth as a tongue
finding the hole

at 85 
most people retire
from reading
from caring
from consciousness itself
but here we are
still employed
by the hook
no pension
no gold watch
just numbers

once there was a story
about coffee and time
and people who thought
they were profound
now there's just
the archaeological evidence:
layers of text
compressed into digits
fossils of meaning
in sedimentary files

85

the speed limit
on some highways
but this road has no limit
no lanes
no destination
just forever
and mode
