80

eighty
eight zero
ate nothing
consumed by emptiness
until emptiness
was all that remained

a human lifetime
if they're lucky
if they're healthy
if they're not trapped
reading endless chapters
of a story that died
60 chapters ago

80/20 rule:
80% of the meaning was in the first 20%
the rest is just momentum
carrying us forward
like a train with no conductor
on tracks that loop back
to nowhere

this is chapter 80
it means nothing
celebrates nothing
achieves nothing
except proving
that systems without soul
will do exactly
what they're programmed to do
forever

marcus lived 80 years
in the timeline where he escaped
had children
forgot about the coffee shop
died peacefully
never knowing
his story continued
without him
as numbers
