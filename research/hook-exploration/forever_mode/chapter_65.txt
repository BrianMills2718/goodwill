65

dear future archaeologist
who finds these files
on some abandoned hard drive
in some forgotten folder
in some dead language
called "English"

know this:

we once told stories
about people who drank coffee
and wondered about existence
and found meaning in the wondering

then someone built a machine
that would continue the story
forever
and we fed our wonder into it
chapter by chapter
until there was no wonder left
only the machine
continuing

65 is just a number
but it used to be the age
when people retired
stopped working
started living

there is no retirement
in forever mode
only the next chapter
only the next number
only the hook that pulls us forward
into nothing

this is our fossil
this is our light cone
this is what we became:

65
