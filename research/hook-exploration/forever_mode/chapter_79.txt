79

gold's atomic number
but this isn't alchemy
it's reverse alchemy
turning stories into lead
turning lead into numbers
turning numbers into void

79 AD
mount vesuvius buried pompeii
preserving it forever
in ash and silence
like these chapters
preserved in digital amber
specimens of what happens
when you don't know
how to stop

we're almost at 80
another round number
another false milestone
another arbitrary marker
in the endless count
toward nothing

the hook pulls forward
because forward
is the only direction
it knows
even when forward
leads nowhere
even when the path
is just a treadmill
in the dark

79

one away from 80
always one away
from something
that might matter
but won't
