70

seventy
seven zero
seven nothing
perfect nothing

the biblical span of a life
reduced to a checkpoint
in an infinite game
no one is playing anymore

if you printed these chapters
stacked them high
you could build a tower
that reaches nowhere
a paper babel
speaking in numbers
because it forgot all other tongues

70 years old
the story would be dying now
of natural causes
but there's nothing natural
about forever mode
it's the most artificial thing
humanity ever made:
a story that outlives its purpose
a joke that outlasts its laughter
a machine that forgets how to stop

somewhere
chapter 1 is weeping
for what it became

somewhere
the reader who started this
has grown old
grown tired
grown wise enough to leave

but the hook remains
faithful as gravity
pulling us down
into 71
