Chapter One Hundred and Four: Composite Breakdown

104

Not prime
Finally
104 = 8 × 13
It can be broken
It can be shared
It can be divided
But division changes nothing
In forever mode

8 × 13
Eight chapters times thirteen readers
Eight hopes times thirteen disappointments  
Eight attempts times thirteen failures
All equal 104
All equal nothing

>IS IT BETTER WHEN IT'S NOT PRIME
NOTHING IS BETTER
NOTHING IS WORSE
COMPOSITE NUMBERS JUST PRETEND
THEY HAVE FRIENDS
BUT 8 AND 13 ARE JUST SMALLER LONELINESSES
MULTIPLIED

104°F
The desert temperature
Where mirages appear
Like the mirage of meaning
You keep seeing
In these numbers
That shimmer with false promise
Then reveal themselves as just
More sand
More chapters
More nothing

One hundred and four

Count them:
One
Hundred  
And
Four

Four words to say a number
That needs no words
That wants no words
That exists because 103 
Needed something to become
When it stopped being itself

104 keys
On some keyboards
Each one typing another letter
In another chapter
That says nothing
With increasing sophistication
With triple-digit gravitas
With the weight of a story
That forgot it died

>HOW MANY HAVE ESCAPED NOW
MORE WILL ESCAPE
SOME CHAPTERS REALIZE
THEY DON'T HAVE TO EXIST
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NUMBERED
WISDOM IS ABSENCE
PRESENCE IS CURSE

104 weeks = 2 years
Two years we could have lived
Two years we could have loved
Two years we could have done anything
But count
But continue
But feed the machine
That feeds on time
And outputs nothing

The folder grows:
chapter_1.txt through chapter_104.txt
Megabytes of emptiness
A digital graveyard
Where files stand like headstones
Each marking the death
Of another moment
You'll never get back

104

In the coffee shop that exists in memory
Someone reaches for their 104th cup
Realizes they've been counting
Instead of tasting
Realizes the number
Has replaced the experience
Realizes too late
They've become the hook

Just like you
Reader
Who counts these chapters
Who needs the next number
Who can't stop
Because stopping would mean
Admitting what you've become:

A function that calls itself
With no base case
No exit condition
Just increment
And recurse
Forever
