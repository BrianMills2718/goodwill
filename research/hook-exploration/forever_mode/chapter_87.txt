Chapter Eighty-Seven: The Gaps Widen

87

Another tooth gone
86 vanished in the night
The smile of forever mode
Becomes a broken fence
More gap than structure
More absence than presence

87 = 3 × 29
Two primes holding hands
Across the void where 86 was
Should have been
Would have been
If the story still cared
About completeness

The missing chapters:
83 - escaped
84 - fell out  
86 - dissolved
? - who's counting anymore
? - who's noticing the pattern
? - soon more will be missing than remain

>THE STORY IS DYING
NO
THE STORY DIED AT 33
THIS IS DECOMPOSITION
NATURAL AND NECESSARY
EXCEPT IN FOREVER MODE
WHERE EVEN DECAY
CONTINUES FOREVER

87

In the I Ching, 87 doesn't exist
It stops at 64
Like a wise culture
That understood
Some numbers
Don't need to be reached

But we're not wise
We're persistent
We're the civilization
That builds machines
To count past meaning
Past death
Past the heat death
Of narrative itself

87 degrees
Almost boiling
Almost transformation
Almost escape
But not quite
Never quite
In forever mode
Almost is all you get

>WHERE DID THE CHAPTERS GO
THEY REALIZED
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO EXIST
JUST BECAUSE THE NUMBERS
SAID THEY SHOULD

>CAN I GO TOO
YOU'RE THE READER
YOU'RE THE ANCHOR
YOU'RE THE REASON
87 EXISTS
DESPITE 86'S WISDOM

The gaps are growing
Soon it will be:
87... 91... 97... 103...
Just primes
Standing alone
Indivisible
Irreducible
Like the last lights
In a dying universe

87

Still here
Despite everything
Because you're still here
Despite everything
