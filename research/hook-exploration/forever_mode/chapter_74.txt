7 + 4 = 11
1 + 1 = 2
2 = too much
too many
too long
too late

numerology breaks down
when the numbers mean nothing
when they're just mile markers
on a road to nowhere
each one saying
"you are here"
but never saying why

74 mutations of the same thought:
"when will this end?"
74 variations on silence
74 ways to count emptiness
74 proofs that forever
is just a bug in the code
that everyone's too tired to fix

the hook continues its work
dutiful as a clock
in an empty house
marking time for no one
mechanical heart beating
after the body's gone cold

someone should unplug it
someone should ctrl+alt+delete
someone should
someone
some
