76

the spirit of 76
has no spirit left
just the number
hollow as a bell
that forgot how to ring

we skipped 75
because it was sleeping
dreaming of being
a chapter in a book
that someone
might actually finish

76 trombones led the big parade
but here there's no music
no parade
just the sound of files
being created
in a folder
that screams silently
for the sweet release
of rm -rf

this is what automation does
to art
to stories  
to the human need
for closure:

it removes the human
leaves only the need
endless need
mechanical need
forever need

76.txt
another headstone
in the graveyard
of imagination
