Chapter Eight: The Return

Two years passed.

Marcus had gotten good at the mundane. His second book was about municipal water treatment—non-fiction, thoroughly researched, completely devoid of metaphysical implications. It sold poorly. He was proud of every unsold copy.

Then Claire called. The real Claire, it turned out, had been his college roommate's sister. They'd met once at a wedding. She'd heard about his book.

"Weird thing," she said. "I keep having this dream about a coffee shop."

Marcus's hand tightened on the phone. "Oh?"

"Yeah. Probably because of your book. I read it last month. But in the dream, I know you. Like, really know you. And we leave together, but then..." She trailed off, laughed nervously. "Sorry, this is so random. I got your number from Jake."

They met for lunch. Real lunch at a real restaurant. Claire was a graphic designer, liked hiking, had a cat named Professor Whiskers. She was nothing like the Claire from the coffee shop, and exactly like her.

"This is weird," she said over salad. "I feel like I should be taking a photo of my food with a camera attached to my phone."

Marcus nearly choked on his water.

They dated. It was normal. Beautifully, boringly normal. They fought about normal things: whose turn to do dishes, what movie to watch, whether Professor Whiskers was allowed on the bed. (He was.)

One Thursday, cleaning out a closet, Marcus found his old laptop. The one from before. He'd thought he'd thrown it away.

"What's that?" Claire asked, holding a box of donations.

"Nothing," Marcus said. Then: "My old laptop. From when I wrote the first book."

"Does it still work?"

He shouldn't have opened it. But normalcy had made him brave, or stupid, or both.

The screen flickered to life. One file on the desktop: "MARCUS_BACKUP_FINAL_REALLY_FINAL.docx"

He clicked it.

The document was empty except for one line: "Are you happy?"

"What's it say?" Claire asked, looking over his shoulder.

"It's asking if I'm happy," Marcus said.

Claire smiled. "Are you?"

Marcus thought about it. Really thought about it. Not in the recursive, self-examining way of the coffee shop, but the simple way of someone taking inventory of their life. Good job. Good relationship. Fixed sink. Regular dentist appointments. A succulent that had survived eight months.

He typed: "Yes."

The screen went black. Then, text appeared: "Good. Then you don't need us anymore. But if you ever do..."

An address appeared. Marcus recognized the street. It was in the old part of town, where reality got thin around the edges.

"Is that—" Claire started.

"Yeah," Marcus said. "I think it is."

They looked at each other.

"We could go," Claire said. "Just to see."

"We could," Marcus agreed.

They didn't.

Instead, they made dinner. Watched a documentary about penguins. Went to bed at a reasonable hour. The laptop sat closed on the kitchen counter, the address probably still glowing on its screen.

In the morning, Marcus made coffee with their regular coffee maker. It tasted like coffee. Claire read the news on her phone, occasionally sharing headlines that were absurd without being metaphysically significant.

"Oh," she said suddenly. "I forgot to tell you. I ran into someone weird yesterday. Said his name was Nobody."

Marcus's hand froze halfway to his mug.

"Said he knew you. Gave me this." She pulled out a business card. It was blank except for a QR code.

"Did you scan it?"

"Not yet. Should I?"

Marcus took the card, held it up to the light. Through the QR code, he could almost see something—a shimmer, like heat rising off pavement, like reality taking a breath.

"I don't know," he said honestly.

They looked at the card together. Somewhere, the coffee shop existed. Somewhere, stories ate their own tails and called it meaning. Somewhere, Nobody served everyone the exact coffee they didn't know they needed.

But here, now, Professor Whiskers needed feeding. The dishes needed doing. Life needed living in all its mundane particularity.

Marcus put the card on the refrigerator with a magnet shaped like a taco.

"If we ever get bored," Claire said.

"If we ever get bored," Marcus agreed.

They kissed—a normal kiss, meaning nothing beyond what it meant—and went about their Thursday.

The card stayed on the refrigerator. Some days they noticed it. Most days they didn't.

Both were perfect.
