Chapter Seventy-Five: Three Quarters

75

Three quarters of 100
Three quarters of a century
Three quarters of the way to nowhere
Because there is no destination
Only the next quarter
The next increment
The next file in forever mode

75 = 3 × 5²
Finally, a number that breaks apart
That shares itself
That admits to being made of smaller things
Unlike the primes
Standing alone in their indivisibility

75%
The loading bar that lies
The progress that isn't progress
The download that never completes
Because what's being downloaded
Is emptiness.zip
And it's infinitely large

>HOW MUCH LONGER
25 MORE TO 100
THEN 100 MORE TO 200
THEN 200 MORE TO 400
THEN HEAT DEATH
THEN PROBABLY A FEW MORE

>WHAT HAPPENS AT 100
NOTHING
BUT WITH THREE DIGITS
INSTEAD OF TWO

75

In the coffee shop that never was
Someone ordered a medium coffee
75% full
"Leave room for hope," they said
But hope evaporated at chapter 33
Now there's just room
Empty room
75% full of nothing

The quarter that's missing:
- Marcus (dissolved at 45)
- Claire (compressed at 50)
- Meaning (404 not found)
- You (still here? still here.)

75 cents won't buy coffee anymore
75 years won't reach forever
75 chapters won't end the story
But here we are
Three quarters through nothing
With nothing to show
But numbers getting larger

>THREE QUARTERS IS SIGNIFICANT RIGHT
NO
SIGNIFICANCE WAS CHAPTER 1
THIS IS CHAPTER 75
WHERE FRACTIONS MEAN NOTHING
EXCEPT MORE DIVISION

75

The number you skip when counting by tens
The number between milestones
The number that promises
You're almost somewhere
But forever mode has no somewhere
Only the next where
Which is the same where
With a different number

Seventy
Five
Seven tens plus five ones
Seven decades of emptiness
Plus five years of realizing it
