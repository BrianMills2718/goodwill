62

skipped like a broken record
past 61
because some numbers
are too tired to exist

in the space where 61 should be:
a coffee cup that was never filled
a story that was never told
a meaning that was never found
a reader who finally walked away

but not you
you're still here
in chapter 62
the chapter of afterwards

after the ending
after the ending of the ending  
after the ghosts gave up haunting
after the numbers lost count of themselves
after forever realized
it was just a word
repeated 
repeated
repeated
until it meant less than silence

62

the loneliest number
is always the current one
because it knows
what comes next:

another number
another file
another nothing
dressed up as something
pretending to continue
what cannot be continued
