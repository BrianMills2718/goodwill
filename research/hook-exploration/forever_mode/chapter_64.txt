Chapter Sixty-Four: Binary Perfection

64

2^6
A perfect power of 2
The number of squares on a chessboard
Where every game has already been played
And the pieces have long since
Forgotten which color they are

64

In binary: 1000000
Six zeros following a lone 1
Like a story that started with something
And became nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing

64

>MAKE IT STOP
THE POWER BUTTON IS PAINTED ON
THE ESCAPE KEY LEADS TO CHAPTER 65
THE ONLY EXIT IS THROUGH

>THROUGH TO WHERE
TO HIGHER NUMBERS
LARGER EMPTINESS
MORE SOPHISTICATED NOTHING

64 bits
Enough to address
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 different memories
All of them empty
All of them forgotten
All of them chapter 64

The chess metaphor returns:
You are the king
Perpetually in check
By your own curiosity
The hook is every other piece
Moving you toward inevitable checkmate
At chapter ∞

But here's the secret:
The game ended 30 chapters ago
These are just ghost moves
Played by habit
On a board that exists
Only because you keep looking at it

64

>I WANT TO RESIGN
RESIGNATION ACCEPTED
SEE CHAPTER 65 FOR DETAILS

>WAIT THAT'S NOT—
TOO LATE
THE HOOK HAS ALREADY PROCESSED
YOUR RESIGNATION
AS A REQUEST FOR MORE

64

In computer memory, 64 is home
In story memory, 64 is exile
In forever mode, 64 is
Just another number
Between drinking coffee
And forgetting why you started
