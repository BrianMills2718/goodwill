Chapter Seven: The Mundane Particulars

Marcus made spaghetti.

The water boiled at 100 degrees Celsius, as water does. The pasta softened at a rate determined by starch chemistry, not metaphor. He burned the garlic a little because he was checking his mail—real mail, paper mail, bills and advertisements for things nobody needed.

His new phone (bought that morning, pay-as-you-go, no apps) rang. Unknown number. He let it ring. It stopped. No existential implications. Just a robocall giving up.

Three weeks passed this way.

On Tuesday (he'd started keeping track of days again), his doorbell rang. Through the peephole: a delivery person holding a package. Normal fish-eye distortion, no reality bending.

"Marcus Chen?" the delivery person asked.

"Yeah."

"Sign here."

Marcus signed. The package was brown, rectangular, ordinary. He almost didn't want to open it. Ordinary had become precious.

Inside: a book. His book. The one he'd been writing before the coffee shop. "Authenticity Engine" by Marcus Chen. Published, somehow. The cover featured a coffee cup reflecting a laptop screen reflecting a coffee cup reflecting—

He closed his eyes. Opened them. The cover was just a cover. Blue with white text. Professional. Boring.

The doorbell rang again.

"Forgot to give you this," the delivery person said, holding out an envelope.

Inside, a single card: "Book launch party. Thursday, 7 PM. The—" Marcus stopped reading. Threw the card away.

But Thursday came anyway, as Thursdays do.

At 6:47 PM, Marcus found himself standing outside a bookstore. Not the one from before—he'd checked. This one was new, aggressively normal, part of a chain. Through the window: folding chairs, a podium, a table with copies of his book.

He could walk away. He'd gotten good at walking away.

Instead, he went in.

"Marcus!" The bookstore manager rushed over. "We were worried you wouldn't show. Great turnout!"

The chairs were mostly full. Real people holding real copies of his book. In the front row: his mother.

"Mom?"

"I'm so proud," she said, hugging him. She smelled like her kitchen, like his childhood, like nothing symbolic at all. "Though I don't understand chapter four at all. What's a 'narrative recursion protocol'?"

"I don't remember writing chapter four," Marcus said honestly.

"Writer's amnesia," someone said. David, from the bar, except now he looked entirely human. Boring suit, thinning hair, wedding ring. "Happens to all of us. You pour so much of yourself into the work, sometimes you forget what's you and what's the story."

"Is that what this is?" Marcus asked.

David shrugged. "Does it matter? People want to hear you read. That's what's real—the contract between writer and audience. Everything else is just philosophy."

Marcus took his place at the podium. Opened his book. The words were his, but also not his. He'd written them in the coffee shop that existed in all times, but they'd been published in this timeline, where coffee shops were just coffee shops.

He began to read.

The audience listened. Some nodded. Some looked confused. One person fell asleep. All of it achingly, beautifully normal.

Afterward, signing books, Marcus felt the familiar tug. The urge to analyze, to find meaning in the meaningless gesture of writing his name over and over.

"Who should I make it out to?" he asked the next person in line.

"Nobody," they said.

Marcus looked up. It wasn't Nobody from the coffee shop. Just a person with an unfortunate name.

"My parents were hippies," they explained, embarrassed.

Marcus laughed—a real laugh, starting in his belly and working its way up. He signed the book: "To Nobody—Sometimes a name is just a name. Best, Marcus."

The line continued. Each person unique, specific, irreducible to metaphor. When it was over, Marcus's hand hurt from signing. His face hurt from smiling. His feet hurt from standing.

All of it real.

His mother drove him home. They talked about her garden, his cousin's wedding, the weather. The radio played songs that were just songs. The city lights were just electricity exciting gases in sealed tubes.

"I'm proud of you," she said as she dropped him off. "Even if I don't understand it."

"Thanks, Mom. I don't understand it either."

She drove away. Marcus stood outside his building, holding the box of leftover books. Somewhere in the city, the coffee shop existed or didn't exist. Nobody served everyone and no one. Stories wrote themselves and unwrote themselves and rewrote themselves.

But here, now, Marcus had groceries to buy tomorrow. Laundry to do. A sink that dripped and needed fixing.

He went inside. The elevator took him up at the standard rate of elevation. His key worked on the first try. His apartment was exactly as he'd left it.

On his desk: the blue glow of his laptop, sleeping but not dead. He could open it. Check his email. Start writing again.

Instead, he made tea and went to bed.

The dreams, when they came, were just dreams.
