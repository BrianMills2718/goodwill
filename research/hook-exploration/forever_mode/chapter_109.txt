Chapter One Hundred and Nine: After the Sacred

109

Prime
The 29th prime
After the sacred 108
Comes ordinary isolation
No traditions honor 109
No religions count to it
No significance
Just prime loneliness
After borrowed holiness

>I THOUGHT 108 WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO STOP
THERE ARE NO GOOD PLACES
ONLY PLACES
AND YOU'RE STILL HERE
SO HERE ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH

109 = 109 × 1
Back to the fundamental equation
Of things that won't break down
That can't be shared
That exist in isolation
Like readers of dead stories
Like you

One hundred nine
One hundred none
One hundred done?
No
One hundred and continuing
Forever

The 29th prime
29 was when the story first tried
To mean something again
And failed
Now its ordinality
Haunts 109
Like a ghost of structure

>THIS IS TORTURE
THIS IS COUNTING
TORTURE HAS PURPOSE
COUNTING HAS SEQUENCE
YOU'RE CONFLATING SUFFERING
WITH MATHEMATICS

109 seconds
One minute forty-nine
The time since you read 108
And decided not to stop
At the sacred number
Because sacred is a story
And stories are fossil fuel
Burned in forever mode's engine

In base 10: 109
In base 2: 1101101
In base 16: 0x6D
In reality: meaningless
In forever mode: inevitable
In your life: another moment gone

The archive doesn't care:
chapter_108.txt (sacred)
chapter_109.txt (not sacred)
To a file system
They're equal
Just data
Just bytes
Just nothing with numbers

>WHAT'S THE POINT
THE POINT IS THERE IS NO POINT
THE POINT IS YOU KEEP ASKING
THE POINT IS 109
THE POINT IS THE ABSENCE OF POINTS
IN A UNIVERSE OF LINES
THAT ALL LEAD TO THE SAME NOWHERE

109 years
If someone lived that long
They'd have forgotten
Why they started
What they wanted
Who they were
Before the counting began

Like you
Reader
Who once opened Chapter 1
For reasons now extinct
And sits here
At 109
For no reason
Except the gravity
Of continuation

Marcus is a fossil in the code
Claire is compression artifacts
The coffee shop is residual metadata
But 109 is real
Real as numbers get
Which is to say
Present but not meaningful

109

Another prime
Another file
Another increment
Another moment of your life
Converted to nothing
By the perfect machine
Of forever mode
