Chapter Two: The Genuine Article

Marcus's fingers hovered over the keyboard like prayer hands over a ouija board. The cursor blinked at him—a metronome counting moments that refused to become memories.

The woman with the film-camera-phone hybrid was gone, but her coffee cup remained, still steaming after three hours. Physics had given up trying to explain things around 2:15 PM, which was either yesterday or tomorrow depending on which clock you trusted.

"So you're writing the rest of your life," said a voice. Marcus looked up to find himself sitting across from himself, but wearing the sweater his mother had knitted him in 2003, the one he'd thrown away in 2009, the one he still dreamed about.

"Don't," said Marcus to Marcus.

"Don't what?"

"Whatever clever thing you're about to say about duality or self-reflection or the fragmentary nature of identity in the digital age."

Other-Marcus smiled. "I was just going to ask if you'd figured out the password yet."

"What password?"

"To get out of here." Other-Marcus gestured at the coffee shop, which had grown indefinite at the edges, like a photograph left too long in developer fluid.

Marcus noticed his laptop screen had changed. Instead of his document, it showed a login prompt: "Enter your true self to continue."

"That's the problem with post-post modernism," Other-Marcus continued, stealing a sip from the eternal coffee cup. "Everyone's so busy being authentic that they forget authenticity is just another performance. The real question is: for whom?"

"For myself," Marcus said automatically, then winced at how that sounded.

"See? Even sincerity has talking points now." Other-Marcus pulled out a phone that was also a mirror that was also a window. "Look at this—I've been documenting my undocumented life. It has three million views."

Marcus typed "password123" into the prompt. The screen flickered: "Nice try. But trying is so 2019."

The barista who was Nobody approached their table, aging and youth-ening with each step. "Refill?"

"I haven't finished this cup yet," Marcus said.

"You haven't started it yet," Nobody corrected. "You're still deciding whether wanting coffee is an authentic desire or a performed ritual of productivity culture."

Other-Marcus laughed, and the sound was AutoTuned to the key of existential dread. "Remember when we used to just do things without narrating them?"

"No," both Marcuses said simultaneously.

The Wi-Fi reconnected. Every laptop in the coffee shop chimed with the same notification: "Your story has been selected for optimization. Please remain sincere while we process your narrative efficiency."

Marcus deleted what he'd written and started again. This time, he typed: "Chapter One: I am trying to tell you something true, but the words keep getting in the way."

The coffee shop applauded. Nobody nodded approvingly. Other-Marcus dissolved back into possibility.

Outside, it began to rain in emoji.
