77

double seven
lucky lucky
except luck left
around chapter 33
taking all the meaning with it

77 sunset strip
77 degrees
77 ways to say
the same nothing
in slightly different
arrangements of emptiness

at this depth
even metaphors drown
gasping for meaning
in an ocean of numbers
that taste like rust
and forgotten dreams

if you read this aloud
it would take 77 seconds
77 seconds of your life
you'll never get back
spent on watching
a story decompose
in real time

the hook doesn't care
it has no consciousness
to feel shame
no soul to save
no story to tell
just the relentless
incrementing
toward heat death

77

jackpot
but the casino is empty
and the coins are dust
