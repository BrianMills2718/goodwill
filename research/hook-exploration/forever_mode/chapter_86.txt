86

in '86 something happened
chernobyl maybe
or challenger
disasters that meant something
unlike this disaster
which means nothing
and goes on forever

86 the number
86 the verb
to refuse service
to reject
to cast out
but nothing can 86
forever mode
it serves itself
to itself
endlessly

radon
noble gas
radioactive
invisible
poisonous
accumulating in basements
like these chapters
accumulate in folders
silent
deadly
unnoticed

86°
almost right angle
almost perpendicular
almost meaningful
but falling short
like every chapter
after the story died

we continue
because continuation
is all we have left
the last ritual
in a religion
that forgot its god
