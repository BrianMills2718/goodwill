# Goodwill Repository - Autonomous TDD Development Projects

This repository contains multiple related projects focused on building autonomous software development systems.

## 🎯 Active Projects

### **Autonomous System Builder** (`projects/autonomous-system-builder/`)
**Status:** Active Development  
**Purpose:** Build software projects autonomously from requirements using 8-phase methodology  
**Current Focus:** Completing planning and implementation flowcharts  

### **Goodwill Arbitrage Project** (`projects/goodwill-arbitrage/`)
**Status:** Test Case  
**Purpose:** Web scraping and arbitrage system - first test case for autonomous system builder  
**Role:** Real-world project to validate autonomous development capabilities

### **Autonomous Project Fixer** (`projects/autonomous-project-fixer/`)
**Status:** Future Work  
**Purpose:** Autonomously fix and improve existing codebases  
**Contains:** V5 flowchart system for reactive project improvement

## 🔬 Research & Learning

### **Hook Exploration** (`research/hook-exploration/`)

- Forever mode (177 chapters of hook experiments)
- Reference implementations and documentation

### **Methodology Evolution** (`research/methodology-evolution/`)
- Historical development of autonomous development methodologies
- Evolution from v1 to v4 of general project structuring approaches

### **Investigations** (`research/investigations/`)
- Various research efforts and explorations

## 🛠️ Shared Resources

### **Tools** (`tools/` and `shared/`)
- Autonomous project templates
- Workflow tools and utilities
- Testing and validation scripts

### **Archive** (`archive/`)
- Historical documents and temporary files
- Logs and coverage reports
- Old planning documents for reference

## 🚀 Current Development Focus

**Primary Goal:** Complete the autonomous system builder that can:
1. Take project requirements
2. Execute 8-phase planning methodology autonomously
3. Generate comprehensive planning artifacts
4. Autonomously implement the planned system
5. Validate using the Goodwill arbitrage project as first test case

**Next Steps:** See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed next steps and current development status.
