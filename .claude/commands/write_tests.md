# /write_tests

Write tests first following TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach.

## What This Command Does

1. Defines success criteria as tests
2. Creates test files before implementation
3. Documents expected behavior
4. Sets up test structure
5. Ensures testable requirements

## When to Use

- After exploring requirements
- Before implementing any code
- When defining success criteria
- To clarify expected behavior

## Actions

1. Create test files for the current feature
2. Write failing tests that define expected behavior
3. Include edge cases and error conditions
4. Document test rationale
5. Ensure tests are runnable (even if failing)
6. Create test fixtures if needed

## TDD Principles

- Red: Write failing tests first
- Green: Implement just enough to pass
- Refactor: Clean up while keeping tests passing

## Next Command

After writing tests, proceed to `/implement` to write code that passes the tests.
