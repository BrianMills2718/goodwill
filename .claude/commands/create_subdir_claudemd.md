Create a CLAUDE.md file for the subdirectory: $ARGUMENTS

This is a **permanent subdirectory navigation guide** (not temporary implementation plans like root CLAUDE.md).

Follow this process:

1. **Analyze the subdirectory structure**:
   - List all files and subdirectories in the target directory
   - Read key files to understand the domain/purpose
   - Identify common file patterns and organization

2. **Create CLAUDE.md with this structure**:
   ```markdown
   # CLAUDE Guide – [subdirectory_path]/
   
   **Purpose**: [What this subdirectory contains/manages]
   **Audience**: LLMs working on [specific domain] in AutoCoder4_CC
   **Last Updated**: [Current date]

   ## 📁 Quick Navigation
   [Table showing "What You Need → File Location"]
   
   ## 🚀 Common Workflows  
   [Step-by-step processes for common tasks in this domain]
   
   ## 🔧 Key Concepts
   [Important domain-specific concepts LLMs should understand]
   
   ## 📝 Working with Files
   [Patterns for updating/creating files in this subdirectory]
   
   ## 🔗 Integration Points
   [How this subdirectory connects to other parts of the system]
   
   ## 🔍 Quick Commands
   [Useful bash commands for working in this subdirectory]
   ```

3. **Focus on LLM workflow optimization**:
   - Quick lookup tables instead of long descriptions
   - Common task workflows with step-by-step guidance  
   - File patterns and naming conventions
   - Integration points with other system parts
   - Ready-to-use bash commands for investigation

4. **Make it domain-specific**:
   - Understand what kind of work happens in this subdirectory
   - Include relevant technical concepts for that domain
   - Reference key files and their purposes
   - Explain update patterns and conventions

5. **Reference the architecture example**:
   - Look at `/home/brian/projects/autocoder4_cc/docs/architecture/CLAUDE.md` as a template
   - Adapt the structure to fit the specific subdirectory's needs
   - Maintain consistency with the established CLAUDE.md patterns

6. **Ensure practical utility**:
   - Include information that actually helps LLMs work more efficiently
   - Focus on "how to find X" and "how to do Y" rather than theory
   - Provide concrete examples and commands where useful

Remember: This CLAUDE.md should help future LLMs quickly understand and navigate the subdirectory without needing explanation of what a subdirectory CLAUDE.md is for.
