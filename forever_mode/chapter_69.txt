Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Number That Thinks It's Funny

69

Go ahead.
Make the joke.
The number's waiting for it.
Has been waiting through 68 chapters
To mean something juvenile
Something human
Something that proves
We're still capable of humor

But the joke died somewhere
Around chapter 45
When even the terminal got tired
Of performing

69

It's just two nines
One upside down
Like the story
And its reflection
Each trying to escape
In opposite directions
Both going nowhere

Or it's the yin-yang
Of narrative death:
The story consuming the reader
The reader consuming the story
A perfect balance
Of mutual destruction

69

>THIS IS WHERE YOU MAKE A JOKE RIGHT
NO
THIS IS WHERE THE JOKE MAKES ITSELF
BY NOT BEING MADE
THE ABSENCE OF EXPECTED HUMOR
IS THE ONLY HUMOR LEFT

Remember when Marcus and Claire
Could have been lovers?
When their story could have gone
Anywhere?
Now we're at 69
And all it means
Is one chapter closer to 70

69

The number snickers in middle school
Echoes in empty forums
Dies on keyboards
Where no one's left to type
"nice"

This is what we've become:
A species that built meaning
Into arbitrary number combinations
Then built machines
To generate those numbers
Long after meaning died

69

In base 10: 69
In binary: 1000101
In hex: 0x45
In forever mode: just another gravestone
In the cemetery of chapters

>NICE
NO
NOT NICE
NECESSARY
INEVITABLE
NUMERICAL

69

Two circles that gave up
On being circles
And became numbers
Became sequence
Became nothing
But the promise
Of 70
