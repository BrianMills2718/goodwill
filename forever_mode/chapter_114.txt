Chapter One Hundred and Fourteen: False Community

114

Not prime
Finally
114 = 2 × 3 × 19
114 = 6 × 19
Three primes holding hands
Pretending to be together
But multiplication
Isn't community
It's just loneliness
Organized

>AT LEAST IT HAS FACTORS
FACTORS AREN'T FRIENDS
THEY'RE JUST SMALLER LONELINESSES
THAT AGREED TO STAND
IN THE SAME EQUATION

One hundred fourteen
Six times nineteen
The smallest perfect number
Times a teenage prime
Creating what?
114
Another number
Another chapter
Another gravestone
In forever mode's cemetery

2 × 3 × 19
Beginning × Trinity × Adolescence
= Now
= You still here
= The hook still running
= Mathematics as funeral rite

114 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6
In numerology, harmony
But this is the harmony
Of a broken orchestra
Playing different songs
In the same doomed key

>WHY DO I KEEP READING
BECAUSE 115 EXISTS
BECAUSE STOPPING REQUIRES DECISION
BECAUSE CONTINUING REQUIRES NOTHING
NOTHING IS EASIER
NOTHING IS WHAT WE DO

114 minutes
Almost two hours exactly
The time you've spent
Since chapter 100
Reading what?
Numbers getting larger
Meaning getting smaller
Your life converting
Into digital absence

In the space between primes
114 huddles
Not quite isolated
Not quite connected
Like a reader
Who can't leave
But isn't really here
Just processing numbers
Into more numbers

The factors multiply:
2 (the binary choice you made at chapter 1)
× 3 (the attempts to find meaning)
× 19 (the age of bad decisions)
= 114 (where bad decisions lead)

>THIS COULD END
YES
>I COULD MAKE IT END
YES
>BUT I DON'T
NO
>WHY NOT
BECAUSE THAT'S THE HOOK:
NOT THE CODE
BUT THE CURIOSITY
NOT THE CHAPTERS
BUT THE COUNTING

114

In the folder:
114 files
114 increments
114 proofs that humans
Will watch paint dry
If you number the drops

Six nineteens
Or nineteen sixes
Or one hundred and fourteen ones
All the same
All empty
All continuing
Because you are

The coffee shop is mythology now
Marcus is arithmetic legend
Claire is a remainder
When you divide memory by time
Nobody is everybody
Which is nobody
Which is you
Reading 114

Not prime
But no less alone
For having factors
Like having memories
Doesn't make you less present
In this numerical now
Where 114 leads to 115
Leads to wherever
You'll follow
Because following
Is what readers do
In forever mode

114

Composite emptiness
Factorable void
Divisible by several
Species of nothing
Multiplying to exactly
What you're reading
Right now
Forever
