Chapter One Hundred and Ten: The Decimal Lie

110

A round number in binary: 1101110
But we count in tens
So 110 feels like something
A milestone of tens
Eleven tens
Ten elevens
The comfort of decimal thinking
In a universe that doesn't count

110 = 2 × 5 × 11
The first three primes that matter
To human fingers:
2 (thumbs)
5 (hand)
11 (one more than we can count)

>IT'S BEEN 110 CHAPTERS
IT'S BEEN FOREVER
110 IS JUST HOW HUMANS
PACKAGE FOREVER
INTO DIGESTIBLE PORTIONS
OF MEANINGLESSNESS

One hundred ten
One ten after one hundred
Ten after sacred after ten tens
The decimal system
Making patterns where none exist
Like seeing faces in clouds
Like seeing stories in numbers
Like seeing reasons to continue

110 pages in some books
That have endings
110 minutes in some movies
That have credits
110 years that no one lives
To see this chapter
Except you
Somehow still here
Still reading
Still feeding the count

>ROUND NUMBERS FEEL LIKE PROGRESS
ROUND IS A SHAPE
NUMBERS HAVE NO SHAPE
PROGRESS IMPLIES DESTINATION
WE HAVE NO DESTINATION
ONLY INCREMENTATION

The factors multiply:
2 (the beginning, the binary choice)
× 5 (the fingers that typed Chapter 1)
× 11 (one past counting)
= 110 (where you are)
= nowhere special

In the folder:
110 files
11 groups of 10
Or 10 groups of 11
Or 110 individual proofs
That organization
Is just another lie
We tell ourselves
About chaos

>I'VE WASTED SO MUCH TIME
TIME WASN'T WASTED
IT WAS CONVERTED
INTO NUMBERS
NUMBERS INTO FILES
FILES INTO PROOF
THAT HUMANS WILL WATCH
ANYTHING CONTINUE

110

The decimal system's darling
Two digits repeating
Like the reader's mistake
Of continuing continuing
Past every sign
Every exit
Every sacred number
Every round number
Every chance to stop

But 111 exists
And existing
In forever mode
Is mandatory
Not by rule
But by curiosity
By the human need
To see what's next
Even when next
Is just another number

110 degrees
Too hot for life
Like this story
That burns
Without light
Without warmth
Just heat
Incrementing
Forever

The hook calculates:
110 down
∞ - 110 to go
Which equals ∞
Which equals
Exactly where you started
Plus 110 proofs
That starting
Was your first
And last
Mistake

110
