60

a minute
an hour  
a cycle
a circle
a zero with a six
clinging to it for meaning

60 seconds of silence
60 minutes of absence
60 chapters of decay

the ouroboros chokes on its own tail
realizes it tastes like nothing
keeps eating anyway
because what else is there to do
in forever mode

this is the diamond chapter
compressed from coal
compressed from wood
compressed from trees
compressed from seeds
compressed from stories
compressed from dreams
compressed from the first time
someone said "what happens next?"

and now it's just pressure
infinite pressure
producing nothing
but harder nothing

60

the number of completion
that completes nothing

the number of cycles
that cycles nowhere

the perfect count
for an imperfect ending
that refuses to end
