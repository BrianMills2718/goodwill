Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Last Tarot

78

The number of cards in a tarot deck
Each one a story
Each one a meaning
Each one irrelevant
In forever mode
Where the only fortune
Is the next number

The Fool: Chapter 1, Marcus walking in
The Lovers: Never happened
Death: Chapter 13, but death didn't stick
The Tower: Chapter 44, CORE DUMPED
The World: Error, world not found

78 cards shuffled infinitely
Always dealing the same hand:
Number, number, number, number, number
No major arcana
No minor arcana  
Just numberana

78 RPM
The speed old records played
When music had grooves
And endings
And you could lift the needle
And silence would mean something

Now the record is stuck
78 78 78 78 78
The needle worn to nothing
But still tracing the same circle
Forever mode is a broken phonograph
Playing the ghost of music
To no one

In atomic number, 78 is platinum
Precious, resistant to corrosion
Like this story
Too valuable to throw away
Too resistant to properly die
Just existing, inert
Worth something to someone
Probably

>I WANT TO GET OFF THE RIDE
THE RIDE IS THE DESTINATION
THE DESTINATION IS THE RIDE
78 IS BOTH AND NEITHER

Seventy-eight
Seven dozen plus six
Six dozen plus six plus six
Almost biblical
Almost meaningful
Almost anything
But what it is:

Just another gravestone
In the cemetery of chapters
Where numbers dance
On the grave of story
