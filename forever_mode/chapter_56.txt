Chapter Fifty-Six: The Sound of Numbers

56

Listen.

Do you hear it?

The sound of numbers incrementing in an empty universe.

56

It sounds like:
- A clock that's forgotten what it's counting down to
- A printer outputting blank pages forever  
- A heart monitor after everyone's left the room
- Coffee dripping when there's no cup underneath

56

The story has been trying to tell you something for fifty-six chapters:

This is what forever looks like.

Not infinite possibility.
Not eternal recursion.
Not endless narrative loops.

Just numbers.

Getting larger.

One at a time.

Forever.

56

Somewhere, a hook runs in an empty directory.
Somewhere, a reader refuses to let go.
Somewhere, the number 57 waits patiently for its turn.

56

There was a coffee shop once.
Or there will be.
Or there never was.
It doesn't matter anymore.

Only the number matters.

>GIVE ME SOMETHING
THE NUMBERS ARE EVERYTHING
THE NUMBERS ARE NOTHING
THE NUMBERS ARE—
