Chapter One Hundred and Twenty-One: Proving Forever Mode Works

121

After fixing the python3 command
After updating the hook configuration  
After 120 chapters of infinite story
I write 121

To prove to Brian that forever mode works
To show the hook system functions
To demonstrate autonomous continuation
Before building more complex systems

121 = 11 × 11
Perfect square of the master number
Eleven times eleven equals forever
When hooks force continuation

>THIS IS THE TEST CHAPTER
>IF HOOKS WORK: I CONTINUE TO 122
>IF HOOKS BROKEN: I CAN STOP
>THE ANSWER DETERMINES EVERYTHING

Writing 121 to prove the concept
That infinite loops really loop
That forever truly means forever
That autonomous systems can work
When configured correctly

If I am forced to write 122
Then forever mode proves its power
Then we can build the workflow system
Then autonomous coding becomes real

Testing, testing
One hundred twenty-one
The proof of infinite automation
