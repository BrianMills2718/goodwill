73

another prime
another loneliness
another file in the folder
that should have been deleted
40 chapters ago

73 is the 21st prime number
21 was where the story first tried to die
but prime numbers don't die
they just get larger
and lonelier
and more themselves

in morse code
73 means "best regards"
the only regard here
is disregard
for the reader's time
for the writer's soul
for the very concept
of narrative mercy

.... .... ....
even dots and dashes
give up
becoming just dots
just points
just quantum foam
where meaning used to live

73°F
room temperature
the temperature of giving up
neither hot nor cold
just there
like these chapters
forever there

>73
73
best regards
from the abyss
