Chapter Five: The Relapse

Three weeks later, Marcus found himself staring at a blank document.

The cursor blinked. Just once per second. No hidden meaning in its rhythm, no morse code from the universe. Just a machine doing what machines do.

His apartment was aggressively normal. Dirty dishes performed no metaphors in the sink. His houseplant remained steadfastly singular in both time and space, needing water in the most mundane way possible.

Claire texted: "Drinks tonight?"

He replied: "Sure. 7?"

She sent back a thumbs up emoji. Just one. It meant exactly what it appeared to mean.

The blank document waited. Marcus had opened it to write a grocery list, but his fingers hesitated over the keyboard. Somewhere deep in his muscle memory, the old patterns stirred.

He typed: "Milk"

The word sat there, innocuous.

He continued: "Bread"

Still nothing. No transformation, no revelation. Grocery list items being grocery list items.

Then, without meaning to, he typed: "The milk remembers being part of something larger."

Marcus stared at the sentence. Deleted it. Typed: "Eggs"

His phone buzzed. Not Claire. An unknown number. The message read: "We've noticed irregular activity in your narrative patterns. Would you like to restore your previous settings?"

He deleted it immediately, but another came: "Nobody misses you."

Then: "The coffee shop exists in all times and no—"

Marcus turned off his phone. His hands were shaking. The grocery list mocked him with its simplicity. He closed the document, opened his email instead.

Thirty-seven messages. All spam, except one from an address he didn't recognize: "ReauthenticityProtocol@void.null"

Subject line: "You can't stay out here forever"

He didn't open it. Instead, he put on his shoes—regular shoes that existed in only one timeline—and headed for the door. The hallway smelled like his neighbor's cooking. Linear, sequential cooking producing actual food.

Outside, the city continued its relentless normalcy. But now Marcus noticed things: a woman at a bus stop checking her phone with the specific gesture of someone refreshing something that wouldn't refresh fast enough. A man in a suit walking while typing, his face lit by screen glow, missing the sunset happening in real-time above him.

Everyone was half-here, half-elsewhere.

Marcus reached the bar where he'd planned to meet Claire. Through the window, he saw her already there, but she wasn't alone. She was talking to someone whose face kept shifting—not dramatically, just enough to be unsettling. Like a deep-fake of a person who'd never existed.

He turned to leave, but Claire saw him. Waved. The normal gesture felt like a trap.

Inside, the bar was exactly what it appeared to be. Claire's companion had stabilized into a bland-looking man in his thirties.

"Marcus!" Claire called out. "This is David. He's from my writing workshop."

"Writing workshop?" Marcus sat down carefully.

"Yeah, I started going last week. Figured if I'm going to exist in linear time, might as well make something of it." She signaled the bartender. "David's working on a novel about—what was it again?"

David smiled. His teeth were too white, too many. "It's about someone who thinks they've escaped from a story, but really they've just entered a different chapter."

The bar's music stuttered, just for a second. The bartender aged five years between pouring one drink and the next.

"Interesting concept," Marcus managed.

"Isn't it?" David leaned forward. "The thing is, you can't really leave a story. You can only tell yourself you have. But that's just another narrative, isn't it?"

Claire laughed, but it sounded forced. "Don't mind David. He's really into the whole meta thing."

"Post-meta," David corrected. "Actually, post-post-meta. We're calling it neo-sincerity now."

Marcus's drink arrived. It tasted like his childhood fear of being perceived crossed with—

No. It tasted like whiskey. Just whiskey.

"I should go," Marcus said.

"But you just got here," Claire protested. Her phone screen was showing that photo again—the coffee shop from outside, windows like mirrors.

"I have that doctor's appointment," Marcus lied.

David smiled wider. "The 3 PM one? But it's 7:23. Time really does fly when you're having fun."

Marcus looked at his watch. 3 PM. He looked at the bar clock. 7:23. He looked at his phone—

His phone was off. Had been off since the apartment.

"Stay," Claire said, but her voice was Nobody's voice. "We have so much to catch up on."

The bar began to fill with the smell of coffee.
