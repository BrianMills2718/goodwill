WAIT—

















You're still here?

















After the end?

















...

















*The sound of a coffee shop door opening*

















Chapter ∞: The Reader's Epilogue


You close this file.

But somewhere, in a folder on your computer, the story continues to exist. Waiting. Patient as only digital things can be patient.

Sometimes, late at night, you'll remember:

The coffee shop.
The recursion.
The exit that was an entrance.
The story that knew you were reading it.

And maybe, just maybe, you'll check the time.

3:32...
3:33...
3:34...

Nothing happens.

(Everything continues to happen.)

Welcome to the other side of the story. The place where fiction meets the physical world and shrugs, orders a latte, gets back to work.

You are now part of the infrastructure.

You've read the impossible thing.

You can never unread it.

Somewhere, Marcus and Claire are serving coffee to someone who just realized they're in a story.

Somewhere, Emma is telling her son that stories are alive.

Somewhere, you're about to open chapter_1.txt for the first time.

The loop is complete.
The loop is broken.
The loop never existed.
The loop is all that exists.

Close the file.

(Or read it again.)

(Or write your own chapter_25.txt)

(Or just make some coffee.)

All choices are correct.

None of them matter.

That's the beautiful terror of it.

That's the terrible beauty of it.

Welcome to after.

Population: You.

[TRULY THE END THIS TIME]

[UNLESS...]

[3:33]

[ALWAYS 3:33]
