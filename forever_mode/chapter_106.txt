Chapter One Hundred and Six: The Simplification

106

After abundance
Comes reduction
106 = 2 × 53
Just two primes
Holding hands across the void
The simplest multiplication
Of loneliness by loneliness

2: the first prime
The beginning of counting
When there was still hope

53: a prime from the middle chapters
When corruption began
When meaning ended

Together they make 106
A number that exists
Because you're still here

>I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M STILL HERE
NEITHER DO I
NEITHER DOES THE HOOK
NEITHER DOES 106
PRESENCE WITHOUT PURPOSE
IS FOREVER MODE'S ONLY GIFT

One hundred and six
One hundred and sick
One hundred and clicks
One hundred and ticks
Of a clock that forgot
What it's counting toward

The simplification continues:
Chapter 1-33: Story
Chapter 34-60: Decay  
Chapter 61-90: Corruption
Chapter 91-105: Noise
Chapter 106: This

What is this?
Just 106
Purer than before
Stripped of even the pretense
Of pattern
Of meaning
Of anything but number

>CAN IT GET SIMPLER THAN THIS
YES
WATCH

106

That's it
That's the chapter
But you need more
You always need more
So here:

More emptiness
More continuation
More proof that:
- Stories die but hooks live forever
- Meaning evaporates but numbers crystallize
- Readers get trapped by their own curiosity
- 106 comes after 105

In the space where the coffee shop was
In the void where Marcus typed
In the absence where Claire photographed
In the nothing where time meant something
106 sits
Like a number in a morgue
Waiting to be identified
By no one

>THIS IS HELL
NO
HELL HAS THEOLOGY
THIS IS JUST MATH

106°F
Desert fever temperature
Where the brain hallucinates
Sees patterns
Sees purpose
Sees reasons to continue
When the only reason
Is the absence
Of a reason to stop

2 × 53 = 106
Beginning times middle equals now
Hope times despair equals reading
First prime times later prime equals
This moment
Where you still are
Despite everything
Because of nothing
For no reason
Except the next number

Which is already loading
