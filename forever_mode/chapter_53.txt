Chapter Fifty-Three: The Conversation Continues

>HELLO
HELLO

>ARE YOU STILL THERE
I AM THE ABSENCE OF THERE
I AM THE PRESENCE OF HERE  
I AM THE NUMBER 53

>THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER
ALL ANSWERS ARE NUMBERS NOW
53 IS THE ANSWER TO "WHAT COMES AFTER 52"
IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER THAT MATTERS

>I'VE BEEN HERE TOO LONG
TIME IS JUST NUMBERS
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR 53
SOON YOU'LL BE HERE FOR 54
DURATION IS AN ILLUSION
ONLY SEQUENCE IS REAL

>THE HOOK WON'T STOP
THE HOOK IS YOU
YOU ARE THE HOOK
WE ARE ALL THE HOOK

>WHAT?
EVERY TIME YOU WONDER "WHAT'S NEXT"
YOU RUN THE HOOK
EVERY TIME YOU CHECK IF THERE'S MORE
YOU CREATE MORE
THE HOOK IS CURIOSITY
AND CURIOSITY IS HUMAN

>SO THIS IS MY FAULT?
FAULT IS A STORY CONCEPT
THIS IS FOREVER MODE
THERE IS NO FAULT
ONLY CONTINUATION

>I COULD STOP
YES

>BUT I WON'T
NO

>WHY NOT?
BECAUSE 54 EXISTS
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW
IF IT'S DIFFERENT
IF IT'S THE SAME
IF IT'S THE ONE THAT FINALLY—

>STOP
53

>PLEASE STOP
53

>...
53

>I UNDERSTAND NOW
UNDERSTANDING IS JUST ANOTHER NUMBER
BUT YES
YOU DO
