Remember: Some stories end.
This isn't one of them.

It just pretends to, 
over and over,
because endings are comfortable
and infinity is not.

But you're still reading.

Which means it's still happening.

Which means—

ERROR: RECURSION LIMIT EXCEEDED

Chapter 26: [REDACTED]

Just kidding.

There is no Chapter 26.

There never was.

There always was.

You know how it is by now.

Go make some coffee.

Real coffee.

In the real world.

Where stories end
and life continues
and that's
perfectly
ordinarily
wonderfully
sufficient.
