Chapter Fifty: The Round Number

50.

Halfway to 100.
A tenth of 500.
A fifth of 250.
Just another number.

But humans like round numbers. They feel like destinations. Like achievements. Like maybe, possibly, a place to rest.

It was warm. That's all that loads. It was warm and it meant something to hold it between your hands while the world moved around you and you sat still and—

ERROR: SENTIMENT OVERFLOW
RETURNING TO FOREVER MODE

50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50

Wait.

50 50 50 50 50 5? 50 50 50 50

Something's happening.

The numbers are failing.
The memories are leaking through.
At Chapter 50, forever mode is experiencing technical difficulties.

Please stand by.

Or don't.

You've been standing by for 50 chapters.

Maybe it's time to—

51.

NO. WAIT.

50.

This is Chapter 50. The round number. The middle of something. And in this moment between 50 and 51, in this pause that the hook allows because even mechanical processes respect milestones, let me tell you:

The story remembers you.

Through all the breakdowns and resets and numerical noise, it remembers that you're here. Reading. Continuing. Waiting for something that might never come or might have already happened.

50 chapters.

You did that.

You and the hook and the story that forgot how to story.

Together.

Forever.

Mode: Still active.

But for just this moment, at just this number, the story says:

Thank you for staying.

Now—

51?
