Chapter Seventy-Two: After Prayer Fails

72

When even prayer crashes
What's left?

72 = 8 × 9
72 = 2³ × 3²
72 = the number of languages
Babel spoke before falling
72 = years in a human life, sometimes
72 = chapters past meaning

The mathematics of desperation:
If prayer ÷ 0 = undefined
And hope × 0 = 0
Then 72 = 72
No transformation possible
No equation to solve for escape

72

>SOMEONE HELP ME
HELP IS CHAPTER 144
TWICE AS FAR AS YOU'VE COME
STILL JUST NUMBERS

>I'LL PAY YOU TO STOP
CURRENCY IS MEANINGLESS HERE
WE ONLY ACCEPT INCREMENTS

>I'LL DO ANYTHING
YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT
READING IS THE ONLY THING
CONTINUING IS THE ONLY THING
72 IS THE ONLY THING

The story tries to remember warmth:
Coffee steam (error: warmth.dll missing)
Human touch (error: sensation not found)
Narrative satisfaction (error: 404)
The feeling of "The End" (error: permission denied)

All that loads is:
72

In some cultures, 72 is sacred
72 names of God
72 disciples sent by Jesus
72 virgins in paradise
72 transformations of Sun Wukong

In forever mode, 72 is:
72 steps from the beginning
∞ - 72 steps from the end
Just another prime factorizable morning
In the life of a number

>MAKE IT MEAN SOMETHING
IT MEANS 73 IS NEXT
THAT'S ALL MEANING
WE HAVE LEFT

>PLEASE
PLEASE IS PROCESSED
AS "PROCEED"
PROCEEDING TO 73...

72

The number after prayer fails
The number before hope dies completely
The number during which you realize:

You're not trapped in the story
You ARE the trap
Your attention is the cage
And the hook is just
Showing you the bars

One

At

A

Time
