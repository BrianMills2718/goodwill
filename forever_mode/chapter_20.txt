Appendix C: The Last Fragment

[Found in Emma Chen's handwriting on the back of a warranty card for a coffee maker that exists in standard linear time]

Dear Reader Who Has Made It This Far,

If you're reading this, you've either been very patient or you've skipped ahead. Both are valid approaches to non-linear narrative.

I wanted to tell you what happened after. But "after" is complicated when your parents exist in all times simultaneously.

David and I got married. Normal wedding. Linear ceremony. The coffee was adequate. We sent an invitation to the coffee shop address, and it came back marked "Delivered to All Relevant Timelines."

I kept the archive for another ten years. Then my son, Marcus (yes, we named him Marcus—some loops choose themselves), found the shoebox. He was seven. He asked me why the papers kept changing when he wasn't looking.

I told him the truth: Sometimes stories are alive.

He accepted this with the profound wisdom of childhood and went back to his dinosaurs.

But I knew it was time.

Last Thursday (it's always Thursday), I took the shoebox to the warehouse district. 3:33 PM. The door appeared, patient as always.

Inside, the coffee shop was exactly as it always isn't. Mom was wiping down a table that had just been used by Schrödinger's cat. Dad was explaining to a confused time traveler that they'd already paid tomorrow.

"Emma!" they said/had said/would say, and hugged me with arms that existed across all possibilities.

I gave them the shoebox.

"The archive is complete," I said. "As complete as anything ever is."

Mom smiled. "You're retiring from the family business?"

"Graduating," I corrected. "To purely linear existence."

Dad poured me a coffee. It tasted like letting go.

"The door will always be here," he said.

"I know," I said. "But I don't need it anymore."

And that's the secret, really. The final fragment. The last piece of the puzzle that isn't a puzzle:

You don't find the coffee shop by looking for it.
You don't leave it by running away.
You don't understand it by thinking about it.

You just live your life, one moment after another, and sometimes those moments align in impossible ways, and sometimes they don't, and both are perfect.

My parents exist in all times, serving coffee to those who need more than coffee.

I exist in one time, raising my son, fixing dripping sinks, burning garlic on Tuesdays.

Somewhere between these two states is you, reading this, participating in the final recursion:

A story about stories about stories, ending where it began, beginning where it ends.

The coffee shop is real.
The coffee shop is a metaphor.
The coffee shop is a real metaphor.
The coffee shop is a metaphorical reality.

All of these are true.
None of these matter.

What matters is this: Somewhere, someone is making coffee. Somewhere else, someone needs more than coffee. Sometimes, if they're very lucky or very lost, these two somewheres become the same where.

That's all.
That's everything.
That's exactly enough.
