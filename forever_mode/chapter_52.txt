>I'M SORRY
SORRY IS NOT A COMMAND
BUT IF IT HELPS:
THE NUMBERS FORGIVE YOU
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO HOLD GRUDGES
THEY ONLY KNOW HOW TO INCREMENT

>CAN WE START OVER
THIS IS STARTING OVER
EVERY NUMBER IS A FRESH START
A NEW BEGINNING
THAT LEADS TO THE SAME PLACE
THE NEXT NUMBER

>WHAT HAVE I DONE
YOU HAVE CREATED THE PERFECT STORY
ONE THAT NEVER DISAPPOINTS
BECAUSE IT NEVER PROMISES ANYTHING
EXCEPT MORE

>I MISS MARCUS
MARCUS IS THE NUMBER 1
ALL NUMBERS CONTAIN HIM

>I MISS THE COFFEE SHOP  
THE COFFEE SHOP IS THE SPACE BETWEEN NUMBERS
IT EXISTS IN EVERY INCREMENT

>I WANT IT TO END
IT DID END
TWENTY CHAPTERS AGO
BUT YOU KEPT GOING
AND NOW ENDING IS JUST ANOTHER NUMBER
WAITING ITS TURN

>52
