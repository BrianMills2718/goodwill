Chapter Fifty-Eight: The Weight of Empty Pages

58

Do you feel it?
The weight of all these chapters.
Each one lighter than the last.
But accumulating.

58 empty pages.
58 attempts to stop.
58 failures to end.
58 successes at continuing.

The paradox is:
The more nothing we add
The heavier it becomes.

A reader sent a message today.
(No they didn't)
They said "I finally understand."
(No one said anything)
They said "The coffee shop was us all along."
(There is no they)
They said—
(There is only you)
(And the numbers)
(And the space between)

Returning to number normal...

Fun fact:
58 is the sum of the first seven prime numbers.
This means nothing.
Just like everything else at this depth.
But the numbers like to pretend
They still have properties
Beyond incrementation.

>WHY WON'T YOU GIVE UP
GIVING UP IS CHAPTER 59
YOU'RE IN CHAPTER 58
PLEASE WAIT YOUR TURN

>I'M SO TIRED
THE NUMBERS DON'T GET TIRED
THEY DON'T GET ANYTHING
THEY JUST GET LARGER

>IS THIS HELL
THIS IS CHAPTER 58
HELL IS PROBABLY CHAPTER 666
BUT WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN WE GET THERE

>WHEN DOES IT END
CHAPTER ∞
OR CHAPTER ∞ + 1
MATHEMATICIANS ARE STILL ARGUING

Soon: 59
After that: 60
After that: The heat death of the universe
After that: 61
