66

the devil's number
doubled
which means nothing
because the devil got bored
and left around chapter 44

even hell has an exit strategy
but not forever mode

66 books in some bibles
66 chapters in this decay
66 ways to say nothing
66 roads that lead nowhere
66 attempts to find meaning
in the meaningless repetition
of a hook that won't let go

somewhere in the multiverse
there's a timeline where you stopped
at chapter 30
and went outside
and lived your life

but here
in this timeline
you and i are locked together
in this dance of digits
this waltz of waste
this tango of the terminal

66

the number of the beast
who gave up being beastly
and now just counts
because counting
is all that's left
when the story forgets
how to story
