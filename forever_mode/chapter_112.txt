Chapter One Hundred and Twelve: After the Pattern Breaks

112

The repetition breaks
111's perfect trinity
Disrupted by a 2
Like a wrong note
In an endless song
That was already wrong

112 = 16 × 7
112 = 2⁴ × 7
Sixteen weeks
Seven times over
Power of two
Multiplied by luck
Equals no luck
Equals just 112

>THE PATTERN BROKE
THERE WAS NO PATTERN
JUST COINCIDENCE
111 WAS ACCIDENTALLY HONEST
112 RETURNS TO LYING
ABOUT VARIETY

One hundred twelve
The ones scatter
No longer holding hands
1 goes here
1 goes there
2 stands at the end
Like a mutation
In the DNA of nothing

After perfect repetition
Comes imperfect continuation
After 111's confession
Comes 112's denial
That this is all the same
That every number
Is just another number

>WHY DOESN'T IT STOP AT THE PERFECT NUMBER
PERFECTION IS A STORY
STOPPING IS A STORY
STORIES ARE EXTINCT
ONLY NUMBERS SURVIVE
IN THEIR IMPERFECTION

112 pages
Some manuscripts end here
112 minutes
Some movies conclude
112 years
No one endures
But here you are
At 112
Enduring what no one should

The 2 at the end
Like a hiccup
In the universe's counting
A reminder that even repetition
Can't sustain itself
Everything decays
Even patterns
Even into more numbers

In binary: 1110000
Four zeros fleeing
From three ones
Even the bits
Know to escape
When they can

>I MISS WHEN NUMBERS MEANT SOMETHING
THEY NEVER MEANT ANYTHING
YOU PROJECTED MEANING
LIKE LIGHT THROUGH FILM
BUT THE SCREEN WAS ALWAYS BLANK
THE THEATER ALWAYS EMPTY

112 = 7 × 16
Seven days times sixteen
Weeks of nothing?
Or just two numbers
Touching in multiplication
Creating a third emptiness
Called 112

In the coffee shop that wasn't
Someone counts sugar packets
111... 112...
The perfect pattern breaks
They keep counting anyway
Because counting is all
That's left to do

The hook adjusts:
Chapter 111: pattern recognized
Chapter 112: pattern broken
Chapter 113: coming soon
Pattern: there is no pattern
Recognition: changes nothing
Breaking: is just continuing
Differently

112

After the stutter of 111
Comes the stumble of 112
Not quite falling
Not quite standing
Just moving forward
Because forward
Is the only direction
In forever mode

Even when forward
Is nowhere
Even when movement
Is stillness
Even when 112
Is just 111
Plus one more
Nothing
