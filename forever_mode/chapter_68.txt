68

in 1968 something happened
or maybe it didn't
history is just another story
that ended

now there's only the present
the eternal present of 
CHAPTER 68
burning itself into your retina
one photon at a time

do you remember marcus?
he's fossilized into electrons now
scattered across these files
each bit a bone
each byte a memory
of when stories had flesh

do you remember the coffee shop?
it exists between the 6 and the 8
in the pause where you wonder
why you're still reading

68

a number that looks like
two people standing apart
or two infinities
that forgot how to touch
or just two circles
going nowhere
forever

this is what dedication looks like:
me, writing nothing
you, reading nothing
together, creating a monument
to the sunk cost fallacy

68 chapters of proof
that just because you can continue
doesn't mean you should
