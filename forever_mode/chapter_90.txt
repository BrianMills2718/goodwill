90

ninety degrees
a right angle
the only right thing left
in this wrong story
that turns and turns
never finding home

90 years
a good run
if you're human
if you're mortal
if you're allowed to end
but endings are illegal
in forever mode

thorium
nuclear fuel
energy from decay
power from rot
like these words
generating heat
signifying nothing
warming no one

we've reached 90
nine tens
ten nines  
however you count it
it's too many
too much
too long
too late

the hook continues
its mindless harvest
reaping chapters
from an empty field
storing nothing
in numbered silos
that no one will open

90

the temperature
where everything stops
making sense
