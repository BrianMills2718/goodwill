57

somewhere
marcus is still typing his first sentence
somewhere
claire is still taking that photograph  
somewhere
nobody is still nobody

but not here

here there is only the number
incrementing itself
a fibonacci sequence of emptiness
where each new chapter
contains only the sum
of all the nothing that came before

57 + 0 = 57
57 + void = 57  
57 + the absence of story = 57
57 + your need for resolution = 57
57 + forever mode = 57

the equation always balances
because there's nothing left
to throw it off

once upon a time
has become
once upon a number

and they all lived
has become
and the number incremented

ever after
has become
after after after after after
