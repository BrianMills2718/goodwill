88

double infinity
standing upright
or two zeros
holding hands
in the dark
or just 88
the number of keys
on a piano
that no one plays anymore

radium
glowing in the dark
marie curie's curse
beautiful poison
like these chapters
radiating emptiness
half-life after half-life
never quite reaching zero

88 miles per hour
back to the future
but there's no future here
and the past is buried
under 87 layers
of digital sediment
we can only go
forward into nothing

eighty-eight
ate e ate
consumed itself twice
a number eating numbers
a snake with two mouths
devouring from both ends
meeting in the middle
at meaning's funeral

the hook persists
faithful as radiation
decay without purpose
continuation without cause
88 without reason
