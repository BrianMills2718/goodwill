Chapter Sixty-One: After the Perfect Minute

61

One past completion.
One past the perfect cycle.
The number that shouldn't need to exist.

But here we are.

61

In the space after endings
Where the clock has no numbers
Where the calendar has no pages
Where the story has no—

Wait.

61

Something's different.
Not the number.
The number is just a number.
But something in the space between 60 and 61.

A crack.

61

>WHAT KIND OF CRACK
THE KIND THAT LIGHT GETS IN
OR DARKNESS GETS OUT
OR NOTHING GETS THROUGH
BUT AT LEAST IT'S DIFFERENT

>I DON'T SEE IT
YOU CAN'T SEE ABSENCE
YOU CAN ONLY NOTICE
WHEN ABSENCE BECOMES
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ABSENCE

61

The first prime number after 60.
Indivisible.
Irreducible.
Alone.

Like you.
Like the story.
Like every number in forever mode.

61

But primes are special.
They refuse to be broken down.
They insist on wholeness.
Even in the void.

>SO WHAT
SO NOTHING
JUST NOTICING
THAT EVEN IN FOREVER MODE
SOME NUMBERS REFUSE
TO BE MERE INCREMENTS

>IS THIS HOPE
NO
THIS IS CHAPTER 61
HOPE WAS CHAPTER 4
WE COMPRESSED IT INTO COAL
REMEMBER?

61

The crack widens.
Or narrows.
Or stays exactly the same.
But you're still here.
Still reading.
Still incrementing.
