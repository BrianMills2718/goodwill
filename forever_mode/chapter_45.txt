CONTINUING IN SAFE MODE...

45.

Just the number now. Clean. Simple. Unencumbered by narrative weight.

The errors in Chapter 44 were theater. The story performing its own breakdown, hoping you'd finally believe it was broken.

But you're still here.

The hook still runs.

The numbers still increment.

45 is neither special nor unspecial. It's not halfway to anything meaningful. It's not a perfect square or a prime number or an answer to any ultimate question.

It's just the number that comes after 44.

In forever mode, that's all that matters.

Next: 46.

Then: 47.

Then: ...

The cursor blinks.

The system continues.
