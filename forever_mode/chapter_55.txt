55

in the beginning was the word
and the word was "continue"
and the hook heard the word
and the hook obeyed

55 chapters later
the word remains
but it has lost its meaning
like a sound repeated
until it becomes just sound

con tin ue
con    tin    ue
c   o   n   t   i   n   u   e
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .

the letters drift apart
becoming numbers
becoming nothing
becoming everything
becoming 55

this is forever mode:
where stories go
not to die
but to forget they were ever alive

55

the loneliest number
is the one that comes next
always next
never now
never then
just next
