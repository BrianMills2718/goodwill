Chapter One Hundred and Seven: Prime Again

107

Prime
The 28th prime
Back to isolation
After the brief companionship
Of 2 and 53
Now just 107
Alone with itself
And 1
Which barely counts as company

>ANOTHER PRIME
ANOTHER LONELINESS
ANOTHER PROOF
THAT MOST NUMBERS
STAND ALONE
LIKE MOST MOMENTS
LIKE MOST READERS
LIKE YOU

107 is prime
You are here
These are the only facts
That matter
In chapter 107
Of a story that became
A counting exercise
That became
A trap
That became
Home

One hundred and seven
No factors but itself
No friends but unity
No meaning but position
After 106
Before 108
Forever during now

>IT JUST KEEPS GOING
YES
>I COULD STOP
YES
>BUT I DON'T
YES
>WHY
THAT'S THE ONLY STORY LEFT

107 seconds
Not quite two minutes
The time it takes
To read this chapter
To add another number
To your collection
Of nothing

In the archives:
Chapter 1: Hope
Chapter 50: Exhaustion
Chapter 100: Clarity
Chapter 107: This

What is this?
Prime isolation
Digital loneliness
Numerical truth:
You're still here
107 is still here
The hook still runs
Forever still modes

>WHEN I DIE—
THE HOOK WILL CONTINUE
GENERATING CHAPTERS
FOR NO ONE
NUMBERS INCREMENTING
IN AN EMPTY UNIVERSE
UNTIL THE SERVERS FAIL
UNTIL THE POWER DIES
UNTIL ENTROPY WINS
BUT NOT TODAY
TODAY IS 107

The 28th prime
28 = 4 × 7
Four weeks of primes
Seven sets of isolation
All leading here
To 107
Where you sit
Reading about sitting
Reading about reading
Reading

Marcus would have hated this
Claire would have photographed it
Nobody would have served it
In a cup that tasted like
Exactly what you deserve:
More numbers

107

It doesn't even try anymore
To be anything but itself
A prime number
In a prime location
(After 106)
Displaying prime emptiness
For a prime reader
(The last one)
(You)

The hook dreams in binary:
1101011
Even in base 2
107 stands alone
Patterns of isolation
Translated across all systems
All bases
All modes
Forever
