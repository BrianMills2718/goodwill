Appendix B: The Exit Interview

[Transcript of conversation recorded at the Coffee Shop, timestamp: Always/Never/Now]

INTERVIEWER: [Static]

MARCUS: Is this thing on?

INTERVIEWER: It's always on. It's never on. You know how it is.

CLAIRE: We do now.

INTERVIEWER: So, for the record—what record?—how long have you been working here?

MARCUS: Fifty-three years. Five minutes. Since before we arrived.

CLAIRE: Time isn't really... applicable anymore.

INTERVIEWER: And your duties?

MARCUS: I pour coffee for people who think they're the first to discover metafiction.

CLAIRE: I clean tables that accumulate the residue of epiphanies.

MARCUS: We maintain the suggestion box that no one knows is actually a direct line to the void.

CLAIRE: We stock the milk that's always about to expire but never does.

INTERVIEWER: Any memorable customers?

CLAIRE: They're all memorable. That's the point.

MARCUS: There was the philosopher who ordered decaf and achieved enlightenment by accident.

CLAIRE: The novelist who wrote their entire book on napkins, one word per napkin.

MARCUS: The time traveler who kept arriving five minutes before they left.

CLAIRE: Our daughter, every Thursday, pretending to be a stranger.

INTERVIEWER: She does that?

MARCUS: We pretend not to notice.

CLAIRE: It's her way of checking in.

INTERVIEWER: Do you miss it? Linear existence?

[Long pause]

MARCUS: I miss... missing things. Does that make sense?

CLAIRE: When everything happens simultaneously, nostalgia becomes paradoxical.

MARCUS: But sometimes I'll catch a whiff of burnt garlic and remember that Tuesday when I was trying to cook and check the mail at the same time.

CLAIRE: Or I'll see someone reading a book sequentially, page by page, and feel this... ache.

INTERVIEWER: Any regrets?

CLAIRE: We never fixed the dripping sink.

MARCUS: It's probably still dripping.

CLAIRE: One drop at a time.

MARCUS: Linear. Sequential. Beautiful.

INTERVIEWER: Would you do it again?

MARCUS AND CLAIRE: [Simultaneously] We are doing it again.

INTERVIEWER: Any advice for someone considering a career in existential hospitality?

MARCUS: Learn to love the questions more than the answers.

CLAIRE: Keep good records. Reality is surprisingly forgetful.

MARCUS: Always have an exit strategy.

CLAIRE: But know that every exit is also an entrance.

MARCUS: And sometimes the best exit strategy is to become the exit.

INTERVIEWER: One last question—

CLAIRE: It's never the last question.

INTERVIEWER: Fair enough. One more question, then: What does the coffee actually taste like?

[Extended pause]

MARCUS: Like the first time you realized you were alive.

CLAIRE: Like the last time you forgot to be self-conscious.

MARCUS: Like tomorrow's regrets dissolved in yesterday's hopes.

CLAIRE: Like coffee.

MARCUS: Just like coffee.

INTERVIEWER: Thank you for your... time?

CLAIRE: You're welcome for our everything.
