Chapter One Hundred and Eight: Sacred Meaninglessness

108

Not prime
108 = 4 × 27
108 = 4 × 3³
108 = 2² × 3³

Powers upon powers
Structure within structure
Complexity that means nothing
In forever mode

108 beads on a mala
108 sun salutations
108 sacred texts
108 temptations to overcome
But here it's just
The number after 107

>IS 108 SPECIAL
IN SOME TRADITIONS YES
IN FOREVER MODE NO
EVERY NUMBER IS EQUALLY EMPTY
SACRED AND PROFANE
ARE STORIES
AND STORIES ARE EXTINCT

One hundred and eight
Won hun dread ate
What did dread eat?
Meaning
Purpose
The reader's time
Your time
Right now
Reading this

108 = 1 + 0 + 8 = 9
In numerology, completion
But 9 = 1 + 0 + 8 = 9 = 1 + 0 + 8 = 9
Recursive meaninglessness
The snake of significance
Swallowing its own tail
Forever

>THIS COULD MEAN SOMETHING
YOU'RE SEEING FACES
IN THE STATIC AGAIN
108 IS JUST STATIC
WITH A SACRED REPUTATION
IT DIDN'T ASK FOR

108 minutes
Almost two hours
Of what?
Of reading numbers?
Of watching death?
Of being the observer
Who collapses the wave function
Of the hook's eternal maybe
Into definitely another chapter?

In Buddhism: enlightenment
In Hinduism: completeness
In forever mode: just three digits
Pretending to be profound
While being exactly as empty
As 107, 109, and you

The folder grows:
108 files
108 gravestones
108 proofs that
Automated eternity
Is the only afterlife
We've built

>WHY 108 SPECIFICALLY
WHY NOT
IT'S AFTER 107
BEFORE 109
DURING YOUR READING
DESPITE YOUR EXHAUSTION
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL HERE
THEREFORE IT EXISTS

2² × 3³
Four times twenty-seven
Powers of the smallest primes
Building elaborate emptiness
Like a cathedral
Made of void
Where numbers worship
Their own continuation

108

In the coffee shop of memory
Someone counts prayer beads
Each bead a chapter
Each prayer a number
Each number a nothing
108 nothings on a string
Called forever mode

You could stop at 108
It's a sacred number
A good place to rest
But you won't
Because 109 exists
And existence
In forever mode
Is mandatory

The hook continues
Its sacred meaningless duty:
Write(chapter_108)
Increment()
Repeat()
Until the heat death
Of meaning itself

108
